He noted that the message of love, harmony and moral courage taught by Lord Jesus Christ has timeless relevance and resonates deeply with India’s own spiritual traditions that emphasise coexistence, compassion and respect for human dignity. Recalling the long presence of Christianity in India, the Vice-President highlighted the quiet yet significant contribution of the Christian community to India’s social, cultural and developmental journey. He lauded the community’s sustained work in education, healthcare, social reform and human development, which has reached even the remotest parts of the country, and described it as an integral part of nation-building. Referring to his personal experience, Shri C P Radhakrishnan said that during his tenure as Governor of Jharkhand, Maharashtra and other States, he had the opportunity to interact closely with several Christian organisations. He also recalled celebrating Christmas every year at a church in Coimbatore during his tenure as a Member of Parliament and the spirit of mutual understanding he shared there. He also cited a historical example from Tamil Nadu, recalling the contribution of Constantine Joseph Beschi (Veeramamunivar), who enriched Tamil literature and culture, underscoring the deep cultural integration fostered by the Christian tradition in India. Emphasising India’s pluralistic ethos, Shri C P Radhakrishnan said that Bharat’s unity lies not in uniformity but in mutual respect and shared values. He emphasised that there is no need for any fear psychosis, as peace and harmony prevail in the country. Drawing a parallel between the spirit of Christmas and the national vision of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat articulated by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, he said that just as Christmas brings people of different faiths together in joy, the idea of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat calls upon citizens to celebrate India’s diversity while standing united as one nation. The Vice-President urged all stakeholders to continue their constructive contribution towards the national goal of Viksit Bharat@2047 . He called upon all communities to work together to eradicate poverty and move towards shared prosperity, stressing that development requires collective effort. He also noted with appreciation that the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India has been in existence since 1944 and has built an extensive network of schools, colleges, hospitals and charitable institutions, enabling it to remain closely connected with the lives of ordinary citizens. Among those present on the occasion were the Governor of West Bengal, Dr. C. V.

मैं आपको इसका बड़ा reason बताता हूं। असल में बीते 11 वर्षों के दौरान भारत ने सिर्फ़ policies नहीं बदली हैं, भारत ने अपना economic DNA बदला है। मैं आपको कुछ उदाहरण देता हूं, जैसे गुड्स एंड सर्विसेज़ टैक्स यानि GST, इसने पूरे भारत को एक integrated, unified market में बदला है। इन्सॉलवेंसी एंड बैंकरप्सी कोड से financial discipline आया, transparency को बढ़ावा मिला, और इससे investor confidence मज़बूत हुआ। ऐसे ही हमने corporate tax reforms किए। इससे भारत, दुनिया के most competitive investment destinations में से एक बन गया है। साथियों, अभी आपने लेबर रिफॉर्म्स की भी चर्चा सुनी होगी। हमने दर्जनों लेबर कोड्स को सिर्फ चार कोड्स में समेट दिया है। ये भारत के इतिहास के सबसे बड़े लेबर रिफॉर्म्स में से एक हैं। Friends, जब policy clarity आती है, तो manufacturing को भी नया विश्वास मिलता है। एक तरफ हम पॉलिसी और प्रोसेस रिफॉर्म कर रहे हैं, वहीं दूसरी तरफ, भारत में मैन्युफेक्चरिंग को बढ़ावा देने के लिए प्रोडक्शन लिंक्ड इन्सेंटिव भी दे रहे हैं। ऐसे प्रयासों से ही आज मेक इन इंडिया अभियान को लेकर दुनिया में बहुत उत्साह है। Friends, Reforms को भारत के Digital Public Infrastructure ने और ताकत दी है। Governance paperless हुई है, economy cash-less हुई है, और system कहीं ज़्यादा efficient, transparent और predictable हुआ है। डिजिटल इंडिया सिर्फ एक प्रोजेक्ट नहीं है ये दुनिया की सबसे बड़ी ‘इंक्लूजन रेवोल्यूशन’ भी है। इससे ease of living बढ़ी है, और ease of doing नए लेवल पर पहुंच चुकी है। और भारत में बन रहा आधुनिक फिज़िकल इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर, इसको और बेहतर कर रहा है। सुधरती हुई कनेक्टिविटी के कारण, भारत में logistics की cost लगातार कम होती जा रही है। Friends, भारत निवेश के लिए एक आकर्षक destination है, ये तो दुनिया मानती है। साथ ही, भारत एक भरोसेमंद, future-ready partner है। और ओमान इसको बहुत अच्छे से समझता भी है, और सराहता भी है। हमारा Joint Investment Fund, अनेक वर्षों से, दोनों देशों में निवेश को बढ़ावा दे रहा है। एनर्जी हो, oil and gas हो, फर्टिलाइजर्स, हेल्थ, पेट्रोकेमिकल्स और ग्रीन एनर्जी हो, ऐसे हर सेक्टर में नई संभावनाएं बन रही हैं। लेकिन साथियों, भारत और ओमान सिर्फ इतने से संतुष्ट नहीं हैं। हम comfort zone में नहीं रहते। हमें भारत–ओमान partnership को next level पर ले जाना है। इसके लिए, दोनों देशों के बिजनेस वर्ल्ड को अपने लिए कुछ बड़े लक्ष्य तय करने ही होंगे। आपका ये काम मैं कुछ हल्का कर देता हूं। मै आपको कुछ challenges देता हूँ। हम Green Energy में मिलकर कुछ बड़ा कर सकते हैं क्या? क्या हम अगले पांच वर्षों में पांच बड़े ग्रीन प्रोजेक्ट्स शुरू कर सकते हैं? हमें ग्रीन हाइड्रोजन, ग्रीन अमोनिया, सोलर पार्क्स, energy storage, और smart grid के क्षेत्र में नए बेंचमार्क्स बनाने हैं। Friends, एनर्जी सिक्योरिटी जितनी ज़रूरी है, उतनी ही आवश्यक Food Security भी है। आने वाले समय में ये एक बड़ा ग्लोबल चैलेंज बनने जा रहा है। क्या हम मिलकर, India - Oman Agri Innovation Hub बना सकते हैं? इससे ओमान की food security को मजबूती मिलेगी, और भारत के agri-tech को ग्लोबल मार्केट तक पहुंचाने में मदद मिलेगी। Friends, एग्रीकल्चर तो एक सेक्टर है। ऐसे ही, हर सेक्टर में Innovation को बढ़ावा देना ज़रुरी है। ऐसे में क्या हम \"Oman–India Innovation Bridge” की स्थापना कर सकते हैं? हमें ये तय करके चलना होगा कि आने वाले दो वर्षों में, 200 भारतीय और ओमानी स्टार्टअप्स को हम जोड़ें। हमें joint incubators बनाने होंगे, fintech sandboxes, AI & cybersecurity labs का निर्माण करना होगा, और cross-border venture funding को बढ़ावा देना होगा। Friends, ये सिर्फ़ ideas नहीं हैं, ये invitation हैं। Invitation—to invest. Invitation—to innovate.

मैं आपको इसका बड़ा reason बताता हूं। असल में बीते 11 वर्षों के दौरान भारत ने सिर्फ़ policies नहीं बदली हैं, भारत ने अपना economic DNA बदला है। मैं आपको कुछ उदाहरण देता हूं, जैसे गुड्स एंड सर्विसेज़ टैक्स यानि GST, इसने पूरे भारत को एक integrated, unified market में बदला है। इन्सॉलवेंसी एंड बैंकरप्सी कोड से financial discipline आया, transparency को बढ़ावा मिला, और इससे investor confidence मज़बूत हुआ। ऐसे ही हमने corporate tax reforms किए। इससे भारत, दुनिया के most competitive investment destinations में से एक बन गया है। साथियों, अभी आपने लेबर रिफॉर्म्स की भी चर्चा सुनी होगी। हमने दर्जनों लेबर कोड्स को सिर्फ चार कोड्स में समेट दिया है। ये भारत के इतिहास के सबसे बड़े लेबर रिफॉर्म्स में से एक हैं। Friends, जब policy clarity आती है, तो manufacturing को भी नया विश्वास मिलता है। एक तरफ हम पॉलिसी और प्रोसेस रिफॉर्म कर रहे हैं, वहीं दूसरी तरफ, भारत में मैन्युफेक्चरिंग को बढ़ावा देने के लिए प्रोडक्शन लिंक्ड इन्सेंटिव भी दे रहे हैं। ऐसे प्रयासों से ही आज मेक इन इंडिया अभियान को लेकर दुनिया में बहुत उत्साह है। Friends, Reforms को भारत के Digital Public Infrastructure ने और ताकत दी है। Governance paperless हुई है, economy cash-less हुई है, और system कहीं ज़्यादा efficient, transparent और predictable हुआ है। डिजिटल इंडिया सिर्फ एक प्रोजेक्ट नहीं है ये दुनिया की सबसे बड़ी ‘इंक्लूजन रेवोल्यूशन’ भी है। इससे ease of living बढ़ी है, और ease of doing नए लेवल पर पहुंच चुकी है। और भारत में बन रहा आधुनिक फिज़िकल इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर, इसको और बेहतर कर रहा है। सुधरती हुई कनेक्टिविटी के कारण, भारत में logistics की cost लगातार कम होती जा रही है। Friends, भारत निवेश के लिए एक आकर्षक destination है, ये तो दुनिया मानती है। साथ ही, भारत एक भरोसेमंद, future-ready partner है। और ओमान इसको बहुत अच्छे से समझता भी है, और सराहता भी है। हमारा Joint Investment Fund, अनेक वर्षों से, दोनों देशों में निवेश को बढ़ावा दे रहा है। एनर्जी हो, oil and gas हो, फर्टिलाइजर्स, हेल्थ, पेट्रोकेमिकल्स और ग्रीन एनर्जी हो, ऐसे हर सेक्टर में नई संभावनाएं बन रही हैं। लेकिन साथियों, भारत और ओमान सिर्फ इतने से संतुष्ट नहीं हैं। हम comfort zone में नहीं रहते। हमें भारत–ओमान partnership को next level पर ले जाना है। इसके लिए, दोनों देशों के बिजनेस वर्ल्ड को अपने लिए कुछ बड़े लक्ष्य तय करने ही होंगे। आपका ये काम मैं कुछ हल्का कर देता हूं। मै आपको कुछ challenges देता हूँ। हम Green Energy में मिलकर कुछ बड़ा कर सकते हैं क्या? क्या हम अगले पांच वर्षों में पांच बड़े ग्रीन प्रोजेक्ट्स शुरू कर सकते हैं? हमें ग्रीन हाइड्रोजन, ग्रीन अमोनिया, सोलर पार्क्स, energy storage, और smart grid के क्षेत्र में नए बेंचमार्क्स बनाने हैं। Friends, एनर्जी सिक्योरिटी जितनी ज़रूरी है, उतनी ही आवश्यक Food Security भी है। आने वाले समय में ये एक बड़ा ग्लोबल चैलेंज बनने जा रहा है। क्या हम मिलकर, India - Oman Agri Innovation Hub बना सकते हैं? इससे ओमान की food security को मजबूती मिलेगी, और भारत के agri-tech को ग्लोबल मार्केट तक पहुंचाने में मदद मिलेगी। Friends, एग्रीकल्चर तो एक सेक्टर है। ऐसे ही, हर सेक्टर में Innovation को बढ़ावा देना ज़रुरी है। ऐसे में क्या हम \"Oman–India Innovation Bridge” की स्थापना कर सकते हैं? हमें ये तय करके चलना होगा कि आने वाले दो वर्षों में, 200 भारतीय और ओमानी स्टार्टअप्स को हम जोड़ें। हमें joint incubators बनाने होंगे, fintech sandboxes, AI & cybersecurity labs का निर्माण करना होगा, और cross-border venture funding को बढ़ावा देना होगा। Friends, ये सिर्फ़ ideas नहीं हैं, ये invitation हैं। Invitation—to invest. Invitation—to innovate. Invitation—to build the future, together. आइए, हम इस पुरानी मित्रता को नई technology, नई एनर्जी और नए सपनों की शक्ति से आगे बढ़ाएं। \"शुक्रन जज़ी--लन!” Thank you! *** MJPS/ST (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205919)",

The minister highlighted that since 2014, 11 Tata Memorial Centre hospitals have been established across the country, along with a national cancer care grid covering over 300 hospitals, ensuring standardized and accessible cancer services closer to patients’ homes. Major expansions, including a Platinum Block at Navi Mumbai, are also underway. Addressing concerns over the growing prevalence of cancer, Dr. Singh said the rise is a global phenomenon, driven by longer life expectancy, environmental factors, lifestyle changes, and early onset of non-communicable diseases.“Cancer today is no longer a disease of old age alone. Early diagnosis has transformed many cancers from fatal to curable,” the Minister said. Dr. Jitendra Singh informed the House that extensive research is underway through institutions such as the Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology (BRIT), Tata Memorial Centre, and teaching hospitals, focusing not only on cancer itself but also on reducing side effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy through radioprotective agents and precision-targeted technologies. Dr. Jitendra Singh said that affordability remains central to the Government’s cancer care policy. At Tata Memorial Centre, nearly 60% of patients receive treatment free or at nominal cost, supported by schemes such as Ayushman Bharat, while even paid services are significantly cheaper than corporate hospitals. The Minister said the Government is ensuring timely availability of essential cancer medicines through public hospitals and indigenous production, reducing dependence on expensive imports. Dr. Jitendra Singh also highlighted that India has developed its first indigenous HPV vaccine, a landmark achievement led by the Department of Biotechnology. The vaccine has a preventive role against cervical cancer, which remains one of the most common cancers among young Indian women. On international collaboration, Dr. Jitendra Singh highlighted Tata Memorial Centre’s partnership with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) under the “Rays of Hope” initiative, which is training healthcare professionals from low- and middle-income countries.He said Tata Memorial uniquely combines patient care, teaching, and cutting-edge research, operating as a deemed university and offering super-specialty training in oncology, paediatric oncology, and nuclear medicine across multiple states, including Assam. Responding to questions on advanced theranostics such as Lutetium-177 PSMA-617 for prostate cancer, Dr. Jitendra Singh said India has developed 24 indigenous radioisotopes over the past decade for diagnostic and therapeutic use.These include world-class innovations for prostate cancer and childhood blood cancers, ensuring that cutting-edge nuclear medicine is affordable and scalable, even in logistically challenging rural areas. ***** NKR/AK (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2206213) आगंतुक पटल  : 124 इस विज्ञप्ति को इन भाषाओं में पढ़ें: Urdu , हिन्दी Department of Atomic Energy Government Scaling Up Cancer Care, Research, and Affordable Advanced Therapies Across India: Dr. Jitendra Singh Cancer Care Being Transformed from Selective Excellence to Universal Accessibility, Says Dr Jitendra Singh in Parliament Nearly 60% Cancer Patients Treated Free or at Nominal Cost at Tata Memorial Centre: Dr Jitendra Singh Rising Cancer Incidence a Global Trend; Early Detection Making Many Cancers Curable: Dr Jitendra Singh प्रविष्टि तिथि:\r\n                        18 DEC 2025 7:48PM by PIB Delhi Responding to a series of questions in Parliament on the rising burden of cancer in the country, Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Science & Technology, Earth Sciences, and MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh today highlighted the Government’s multi-pronged, future-ready strategy to strengthen cancer prevention, diagnosis, treatment, research, and affordability, particularly for economically weaker sections. Addressing concerns related to hospital admissions, rising cancer incidence, affordability of medicines, vaccines, global collaborations, and access to advanced nuclear therapies, the Minister said the Government is transforming cancer care from selective excellence to universal accessibility, driven by research, technology, and public health integration. Dr. Jitendra Singh acknowledged that cancer patients and their families often face emotional and logistical stress during hospital admissions.

Dr Jitendra Singh explained that the Bill consolidates and rationalises provisions from the Atomic Energy Act, 1962, the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act, and now accords statutory status to the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, making it part of the parent legislation. This, he said, strengthens regulatory oversight rather than diluting it, and reflects India’s commitment to global best practices in nuclear governance. Highlighting the changing global and technological context, Dr Jitendra Singh said that objections raised to nuclear reforms in 2010 must be viewed in the light of today’s realities, where technology, safety systems and global energy demands have transformed dramatically. Concepts such as Small Modular Reactors and Bharat Small Reactors, he noted, were unimaginable fifteen years ago, but are now emerging as safe, efficient, and flexible solutions for clean, 24×7 power generation. Addressing safety concerns, the Minister categorically stated that nuclear safety standards remain unchanged and uncompromised, governed by the same stringent principles enshrined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1962- “safety first, production next.” He detailed the rigorous inspection regime, including quarterly inspections during construction, biannual inspections during operation, five-yearly licence renewals, enhanced powers to the now-statutory Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, and oversight aligned with International Atomic Energy Agency parameters. He further reassured the House that India’s nuclear plants are geographically located far from seismic fault zones and that radiation levels at Indian reactors are many times below prescribed global safety limits. Dr Jitendra Singh also addressed public health apprehensions, stating that there is no scientific evidence of carcinogenic impact from Indian nuclear reactors. He cited radiation emission data in micro-sieverts, demonstrating that levels at facilities such as Kudankulam, Kalpakkam, Rawatbhata and Tarapur are far below permissible limits. He added that India has significantly upgraded cyber security safeguards in the nuclear sector, including encryption, secure coding, regular audits, malware filtering, and multi-layered digital protection, reflecting new-age threat preparedness. Clarifying misconceptions about privatisation, the Minister stated that while exploration activities may involve private partners under defined conditions, uranium mining beyond specified thresholds will remain exclusively with the government. Similarly, spent fuel management will always remain under government custody, following a clearly defined, long-term storage and handling protocol. Strategic materials such as source material, fissile material and heavy water will continue to be under strict government control. On liability and compensation, Dr Jitendra Singh explained that the Bill introduces graded liability caps to encourage participation by smaller investors without diluting victim compensation. He assured that in the event of damage exceeding operator liability limits, full compensation mechanisms are provided through government-backed funds and international conventions, ensuring that affected parties are not left unprotected. The definition of “nuclear damage” has also been expanded to explicitly include environmental damage. The Minister highlighted the introduction of the Atomic Energy Redressal Commission, stating that it is meant to provide an additional, faster dispute-resolution mechanism for citizens, without restricting access to civil courts or higher judiciary. He rejected claims that the Bill places nuclear matters outside judicial scrutiny. Responding to concerns on sovereignty and foreign influence, Dr Jitendra Singh asserted that India will adopt only those international best practices that suit Indian conditions, without compromising strategic autonomy or traditional strengths. He reiterated that the SHANTI Bill pertains strictly to civilian nuclear energy, with uranium enrichment levels limited to reactor requirements and completely unrelated to weapons-grade activities. Dr Jitendra Singh also drew attention to the expanding role of nuclear science in healthcare, agriculture, food preservation, and cancer treatment, citing advances in nuclear medicine for childhood leukaemia and prostate cancer through institutions such as Tata Memorial Centre. He said liberalising research participation would accelerate innovation across these sectors. Outlining India’s long-term nuclear energy roadmap, the Minister stated that the country has already achieved nearly 9 GW of nuclear capacity, with targets of 22 GW by 2032, 47 GW by 2037, 67 GW by 2042 and 100 GW by 2047, contributing nearly 10% of India’s total energy needs. He emphasised that nuclear power will be indispensable in meeting future energy demands driven by artificial intelligence and digital infrastructure, as it provides reliable, round-the-clock clean energy unlike intermittent sources. Concluding his address, Dr Jitendra Singh said the SHANTI Bill reflects India’s confidence, scientific maturity, and readiness to lead responsibly in the global clean energy transition. He assured Members that the Government remains open to constructive inputs and will continue engaging stakeholders during rule-making, reaffirming that India’s nuclear journey will be guided by safety, transparency, and national interest. ***** NKR/AK (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2206211) आगंतुक पटल  : 274 इस विज्ञप्ति को इन भाषाओं में पढ़ें: Urdu Department of Atomic Energy Rajya Sabha passes SHANTI Bill 2025, after it was passed by Lok Sabha Government Retains Full Control Over Strategic Materials, Spent Fuel, and Nuclear Safety Remains Non-Negotiable Under SHANTI Bill: Dr Jitendra Singh From Hospitals to Farms to Cancer Care: Nuclear Science Driving India’s Everyday Life, Says Dr Jitendra Singh PM Modi’s Vision Unlocks Nuclear Energy Reforms While Safeguarding Safety, Sovereignty and Public Interest: Dr Jitendra Singh Radiation at Indian Nuclear Plants Well Below Global Limits; No Cancer Risk, Dr. Jitendra Singh at Rajya Sabha प्रविष्टि तिथि:\r\n                        18 DEC 2025 7:45PM by PIB Delhi Following the passage of The Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill, 2025 by the Lok Sabha, Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Science & Technology, Earth Sciences, and Minister of State in the PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh today participated in an extensive discussion on the Bill in the Rajya Sabha, clarifying key provisions, addressing concerns raised by Members, and firmly underlining that nuclear safety, national sovereignty and public accountability remain non-negotiable.

These measures are aimed at reducing procedural requirements, enhancing ease of doing business, and facilitating timely and efficient utilisation of washery rejects while ensuring environmental responsibility. At present, the coal washery rejects from the coal washeries are disposed as per the policy dated 27.05.2021 issued by Ministry of Coal for handling & disposal of washery rejects.  These rejects are disposed in order of priority, with 1 st priority given for use of washery rejects for extraction of energy. This is in line with Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, which requires extraction of energy from solid wastes of high calorific value of 1500 kcal/kg or more. The 2 nd priority is for replacement of construction material, reclamation of land, brick making or any other alternative gainful use. If both the above options do not fructify, the last option is to dump the washery rejects in mine voids or low- lying areas in an environment friendly manner. The disposal of washery rejects in all the above three options required prior permission of the Coal Controller Organisation (CCO) and that required some processing time at CCO. In the spirit of ease of doing business, Government has now dispensed with the requirement of prior permission of CCO for the disposal of washery rejects under the first two options i.e. extraction of energy and replacement of construction material, reclamation of land, brick making or any other alternative gainful use. Prior permission of CCO for the last option continues considering the close involvement of CCO in the disposal of washery rejects under the last option. CCO continues to have the power to inspect concerned washery, check the records and draw the samples from the reject stock / reject in transit for verifying the GCV.  The amendment in the Policy may be seen at the weblink https://coal.gov.in/sites/default/files/2025-12/18-12-2025crp.pdf Dispensation with the requirement of prior permission of CCO for the disposal of washery rejects has simplified the entire process and would expedite the disposal of washery rejects. Washery rejects can now be disposed at a faster, simpler and efficient manner. The simplified framework is expected to facilitate faster, simpler, and more efficient disposal of coal washery rejects, encouraging their productive utilisation and reducing operational delays.

Qais bin Mohammed Al Yousef, marking a major milestone in India’s strategic engagement with the Gulf region. Agreement Unlocks Export Opportunity for India’s Labour-Intensive Sectors including textiles, leather, footwear, gems & jewellery, engineering products, plastics, furniture, agricultural products, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and automobiles generating employment and empowering artisans, women-led enterprises and MSMEs Unprecedented Market Access for Indian Goods with zero-duty access on 98.08% of Oman’s tariff lines, covering 99.38% of India’s exports by value This is the 2nd Free Trade Agreement signed in the last 6 months after United Kingdom Ambitious Services Commitments - First of its kind by Oman Oman has offered 127 sub-sectors: A wide-ranging package covers Computer Related Services, Business Services, Professional services, Audio visual services, R & D Services, Education services and Health Services -   unlocking high-value opportunities and job creation. Enhanced Mobility for Indian Professionals For the first time, Oman has offered commitments across key Mode 4 categories, High quality temporary entry and temporary stay commitments for Intra-Corporate Transferees, and Contractual Service Suppliers, Business Visitors  and Independent Professionals and liberalised entry and stay for professionals in accountancy, taxation, architecture, medical and allied sectors Commitment on 100% Foreign Direct Investment for Indian companies in major services sectors (Mode 3) Provision for future negotiations on Social Security coverage of workers upon implementation of Oman’s contributory social security system First-ever commitment by any country on Traditional Medicine across all modes opening significant opportunities for India’s AYUSH and wellness sectors, promotes medical value travel, and strengthens cooperation in traditional healthcare systems. Fast tracking of marketing authorizations for Pharmaceutical products approved by USFDA, EMA, UKMHRA, etc.; acceptance of GMP inspection documents reducing time and cost for Indian pharma exporters. Facilitates mutual recognition arrangements for Halal certification, acceptance of India’s NPOP certification for organic products, and enhanced cooperation in standards and conformity assessment. प्रविष्टि तिथि:\r\n                18 DEC 2025 3:53PM by PIB Delhi India and Oman have taken a significant step in building a stronger economic partnership with the signing of Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement today under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. Commerce and Industry Minister Shri Piyush Goyal and Oman’s Minister of Commerce, Industry & Investment Promotion H.E. Qais bin Mohammed Al Yousef signed the agreement. This Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) marks an important milestone in India’s engagement with the Gulf region and reflects the shared commitment to deepen bilateral economic integration. Oman is an important strategic partner in the region and is a key gateway for Indian goods and services to the wider Middle East and Africa. Nearly 7 lakh Indian nationals reside in Oman, including Indian merchant families with a presence of over 200–300 years, contributing significantly to Oman’s economy and society. Indian enterprises have built a strong presence in Oman, with over 6,000 Indian establishments operating across sectors. Annual remittances of around USD 2 billion further reflect the depth of economic engagement. Bilateral trade between India and Oman stands at over USD 10 billion, with strong potential for expansion under the CEPA framework. This is the 2nd Free Trade Agreement signed in the last 6 months after United Kingdom and is a part of strategy to sign trade agreements with developed economies that are not competing with our labour-intensive interests and provide opportunities for Indian businesses. The CEPA secures unprecedented tariff concessions for India from Oman. Oman has offered zero-duty access on 98.08% of its tariff lines, covering 99.38% of India’s exports to Oman. All major labour-intensive sectors including Gems & Jewellery, Textiles, leather, footwear, sports goods, plastics, furniture, agricultural products, engineering products, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and Automobiles receive full tariff elimination.  Out of the above, immediate tariff elimination is being offered on 97.96% Tariff Lines. India is offering tariff liberalization on 77.79% of its total tariff lines (12556) which covers 94.81% of India’s imports from Oman by value. For the products of export interest to Oman and which are sensitive to India, the offer is mostly a tariff-rate quota (TRQ) based tariff liberalization. To safeguard its interest, sensitive products have been kept in the exclusion category by India without offering any concessions, especially agricultural products, including dairy, tea, coffee, rubber, and tobacco products; gold and silver bullion, jewellery; other labour-intensive products such as footwear, sports goods; and scrap of many base metals. The Services sector, a strong driver of India’s economy, will also see wide-ranging benefits. Oman’s substantial global services imports amounting to USD 12.52 billion, with the share of India's exports in Oman's global imports basket as 5.31%, indicating significant untapped potential for Indian service providers. The agreement features a comprehensive and forward-looking services package, with Oman extending substantial commitments across a broad spectrum of sectors including Computer Related Services, Business and Professional Services, Audio-visual Services, Research and Development, Education and Health Services. These commitments are expected to unlock significant new opportunities for Indian service providers, promote high-value job creation, and support expanding commercial engagement between the two countries. A major highlight of the CEPA is the enhanced mobility framework for Indian professionals. For the first time, Oman has offered wide-ranging commitments under Mode 4, including a notable increase in the quota for Intra-Corporate Transferees from 20 per cent to 50 per cent, together with a longer permitted duration of stay for Contractual Service Suppliers—extended from the existing 90 days to two years, with the possibility of a further two-year extension. The agreement also provides for more liberal entry and stay conditions for skilled professionals in key sectors such as accountancy, taxation, architecture, medical and allied services, supporting deeper and more seamless professional engagement. The CEPA further provides for 100 per cent Foreign Direct Investment by Indian companies in major services sectors in Oman through commercial presence, opening a wide avenue for India’s services industry to expand operations in the region. In addition, both sides have agreed to hold future discussions on social security coordination once Oman’s contributory social security system is implemented, reflecting a forward-looking approach to facilitating labour mobility and worker protection. A landmark element of the Agreement is Oman’s commitment on Traditional Medicine extended across all modes of supply representing the first such comprehensive commitment made by any country, and creating a significant opportunity for India’s AYUSH and wellness sectors to showcase its strength in the Gulf region. Apart from the above, provisions in CEPA also address non-tariff barriers persisting despite tariff concessions, limiting real market access. This is the first bilateral agreement that Oman has signed with any country since United States of America in 2006. Union Minister for Commerce and Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal, expressed profound gratitude to Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi for his visionary guidance, stating: “The India-Oman CEPA strengthens the historical strong ties of India with Oman and signifies an ambitious and balanced economic framework that significantly enhances opportunities for Indian exporters and professionals. It unlocks nearly universal duty free access for Indian goods in the Omani market, expands services commitments across key high growth sectors, and ensures greater mobility for Indian professionals.

Commerce and Industry Minister Shri Piyush Goyal and Oman’s Minister of Commerce, Industry & Investment Promotion H.E. Qais bin Mohammed Al Yousef signed the agreement. This Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) marks an important milestone in India’s engagement with the Gulf region and reflects the shared commitment to deepen bilateral economic integration. Oman is an important strategic partner in the region and is a key gateway for Indian goods and services to the wider Middle East and Africa. Nearly 7 lakh Indian nationals reside in Oman, including Indian merchant families with a presence of over 200–300 years, contributing significantly to Oman’s economy and society. Indian enterprises have built a strong presence in Oman, with over 6,000 Indian establishments operating across sectors. Annual remittances of around USD 2 billion further reflect the depth of economic engagement. Bilateral trade between India and Oman stands at over USD 10 billion, with strong potential for expansion under the CEPA framework. This is the 2nd Free Trade Agreement signed in the last 6 months after United Kingdom and is a part of strategy to sign trade agreements with developed economies that are not competing with our labour-intensive interests and provide opportunities for Indian businesses. The CEPA secures unprecedented tariff concessions for India from Oman. Oman has offered zero-duty access on 98.08% of its tariff lines, covering 99.38% of India’s exports to Oman. All major labour-intensive sectors including Gems & Jewellery, Textiles, leather, footwear, sports goods, plastics, furniture, agricultural products, engineering products, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and Automobiles receive full tariff elimination.  Out of the above, immediate tariff elimination is being offered on 97.96% Tariff Lines. India is offering tariff liberalization on 77.79% of its total tariff lines (12556) which covers 94.81% of India’s imports from Oman by value. For the products of export interest to Oman and which are sensitive to India, the offer is mostly a tariff-rate quota (TRQ) based tariff liberalization. To safeguard its interest, sensitive products have been kept in the exclusion category by India without offering any concessions, especially agricultural products, including dairy, tea, coffee, rubber, and tobacco products; gold and silver bullion, jewellery; other labour-intensive products such as footwear, sports goods; and scrap of many base metals. The Services sector, a strong driver of India’s economy, will also see wide-ranging benefits. Oman’s substantial global services imports amounting to USD 12.52 billion, with the share of India's exports in Oman's global imports basket as 5.31%, indicating significant untapped potential for Indian service providers. The agreement features a comprehensive and forward-looking services package, with Oman extending substantial commitments across a broad spectrum of sectors including Computer Related Services, Business and Professional Services, Audio-visual Services, Research and Development, Education and Health Services. These commitments are expected to unlock significant new opportunities for Indian service providers, promote high-value job creation, and support expanding commercial engagement between the two countries. A major highlight of the CEPA is the enhanced mobility framework for Indian professionals. For the first time, Oman has offered wide-ranging commitments under Mode 4, including a notable increase in the quota for Intra-Corporate Transferees from 20 per cent to 50 per cent, together with a longer permitted duration of stay for Contractual Service Suppliers—extended from the existing 90 days to two years, with the possibility of a further two-year extension. The agreement also provides for more liberal entry and stay conditions for skilled professionals in key sectors such as accountancy, taxation, architecture, medical and allied services, supporting deeper and more seamless professional engagement. The CEPA further provides for 100 per cent Foreign Direct Investment by Indian companies in major services sectors in Oman through commercial presence, opening a wide avenue for India’s services industry to expand operations in the region. In addition, both sides have agreed to hold future discussions on social security coordination once Oman’s contributory social security system is implemented, reflecting a forward-looking approach to facilitating labour mobility and worker protection. A landmark element of the Agreement is Oman’s commitment on Traditional Medicine extended across all modes of supply representing the first such comprehensive commitment made by any country, and creating a significant opportunity for India’s AYUSH and wellness sectors to showcase its strength in the Gulf region. Apart from the above, provisions in CEPA also address non-tariff barriers persisting despite tariff concessions, limiting real market access. This is the first bilateral agreement that Oman has signed with any country since United States of America in 2006. Union Minister for Commerce and Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal, expressed profound gratitude to Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi for his visionary guidance, stating: “The India-Oman CEPA strengthens the historical strong ties of India with Oman and signifies an ambitious and balanced economic framework that significantly enhances opportunities for Indian exporters and professionals. It unlocks nearly universal duty free access for Indian goods in the Omani market, expands services commitments across key high growth sectors, and ensures greater mobility for Indian professionals. The agreement reinforces India’s commitment to inclusive growth benefiting farmers, artisans, workers, MSMEs while safeguarding core national interests.” The CEPA is expected to significantly boost bilateral trade, generate employment, expand exports, strengthen supply chains, and open new avenues for deeper, long-term economic engagement between India and Oman.

This core idea was highlighted through the launch of an important film and coffee table book titled ‘Sanskriti Jammu & Kashmir’, held at the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA). The program was organized by the Media Centre of IGNCA. The film has been produced by IGNCA. The writer and co-producer of the film is Mr. Rajan Khanna, while the director and editor is Shivansh Khanna. The program was presided over by Dr. Sachchidanand Joshi, Member Secretary of IGNCA. On this occasion, senior writer and broadcaster Mr. Gaurishankar Raina, the film’s writer Mr. Rajan Khanna, and Controller of the Media Centre Mr. Anurag Punetha were present. A meaningful panel discussion on ‘Sanskriti Jammu & Kashmir’ was also held, in which Dr. Sachchidanand Joshi, Mr. Rajan Khanna, and Mr. Gaurishankar Raina shared their views. Dr. Sachchidanand Joshi said that shooting at the locations featured in 'Sanskriti Jammu & Kashmir' was not easy, as these areas are not only geographically difficult but have also become very hard to access in recent times. Photographs of some of these places are rarely seen. The film includes footage shot at such rare locations. Speaking about the significance of the film, he said that amid continuous attempts to distort and destroy history and to erase our traditional beliefs, this film will stand like a lighthouse. It will illuminate what our traditions are and what our history is. Through this film, many young people—who may not know the real history of Jammu and Kashmir but wish to understand it—can certainly be connected. Towards the end, he also requested the film’s director Shivansh Khanna to disseminate some powerful shots and visuals of important temples through short reels. This would attract people to watch the full film and also help in its wider promotion. The film’s writer Rajan Khanna said that just as there is a relationship between body and soul, there is also a relationship between nation, culture, and geography. The body is perishable, but the nation and culture are eternal. India is like a bouquet of flowers, and among them, the culture of Jammu and Kashmir is a distinct flower—one that embodies spirituality, history, and thought. When one visits the region, it is not just about visiting temples; the hymns of the Vedas, which form the foundation of Indian culture, are inscribed there, and their complete philosophy can be experienced. The vision of the great culture created by our ancestors is clearly visible in Jammu and Kashmir. He further said that whenever Kashmir is mentioned, discussions often revolve around terrorism, jihad, or organizations such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. But when Kashmir is discussed, why is there no mention of its 10,000-year-old history? Why is there no discussion about Anantnag, considered one of the world’s most ancient cities? Why is Kashmir’s history limited only to the period from 1339 to 1819? Kashmir’s history is also connected to the Rigveda. If we do not re-establish our civilizational foundation ourselves, whom will we blame? Even the future will not forgive us. Mr. Gaurishankar Raina said that making such a film is extremely challenging. He has personally gone through this process and knows that it is not easy—especially making films on temples, which requires multiple permissions and access to places that are often difficult to reach. There are many hardships involved. He added that the research associated with such films is also very time-consuming and labor-intensive. Today is the age of electronic and digital media, and in such times, film is an extremely important medium through which one can convey meaningful narratives. Earlier, in his inaugural address, Mr. Anurag Punetha said that whenever a film is made that documents something from a historical and cultural perspective, it performs a very significant task. Especially at a time when, for the last three or four decades, Kashmir has been primarily portrayed as a conflict zone, it is very important—through IGNCA and the visual medium of film—to convey to the country that Jammu and Kashmir has a rich cultural heritage, which still exists today. Its architecture remains an integral part of our collective memory. A society that forgets its heritage while remembering everything else faces a serious crisis. This film is a modest attempt to bring that memory back before everyone. Mr. Punetha concluded by expressing his gratitude to the speakers, guests, and attendees. The program was moderated by Narendra Singh from the Media Centre. *About the Film* The film 'Sanskriti: Jammu & Kashmir’ is set against the breathtaking landscapes of Jammu and Kashmir. It begins with a calm and profound remembrance of the region’s ancient spiritual consciousness—of a land that historian Kalhana once described in his 'Rajatarangini' as being adorned with countless temples. Even today, some of these temples stand in their dignified presence, while many others remain as ruins—silent witnesses to the passage of time and historical upheavals. Through vivid and impactful visuals, the film brings forth the efforts made by Sikh and Dogra rulers to revive temples and religious sites. It also highlights the philosophical and intellectual legacy of the Fourth Buddhist Council held at Harwan Monastery in Srinagar, as well as the Sikh tradition associated with the visit of Guru Hargobind Ji. The film sheds light on lesser-known spiritual traditions of the Jammu and Kashmir region that have largely remained neglected—from the ancient Mamleshwar Temple in Pahalgam to the forgotten shrines around Gulmarg and the historic temples of Jammu. ‘Sanskriti: Jammu & Kashmir’ emerges as a cinematic rediscovery, inviting viewers to reconnect with a long-suppressed cultural and spiritual narrative. The film introduces audiences to a land where every stone carries within it the weight of memory, devotion, and cultural continuity. ***** Sunil Kumar Tiwari pibculture[at]gmail[dot]com (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2206275) आगंतुक पटल  : 73 Ministry of Culture ‘Sanskriti Jammu & Kashmir’ stands like a lighthouse amid continuous attempts to destroy traditions: Dr. Sachchidanand Joshi Kashmir is the land of the Rigveda : Rajan Khanna प्रविष्टि तिथि:\r\n                        18 DEC 2025 8:57PM by PIB Delhi Jammu and Kashmir is not merely a region endowed with natural beauty; since ancient times it has also been a center of India’s cultural, spiritual, and philosophical consciousness.

The meeting saw participation from Dr. Sukanta Majumdar, the Hon’ble Minister of State of MDoNER; Secretary, MDoNER; and other senior officers of MDoNER and the State Government. The meeting reviewed the overall approach to developing the Matabari circuit as a model tourism destination and placed strong emphasis on capacity building, ensuring that local people are meaningfully engaged and motivated by the opportunities created through tourism, particularly in terms of sustained livelihoods. Shri Scindia stressed that historians of Tripura should also be actively involved in the tourism ecosystem and engaged in training tourist guides and assistants to impart authentic knowledge of the State’s history. This process should be institutionalised, blending traditional knowledge with modern training practices. The discussions highlighted that the beauty of Tripura lies in keeping history alive in its antiquity with a modern setting, adopting an organic and natural approach. Development under the Matabari circuit should visibly reflect the history of Tripura, ensuring that soft aesthetics are maintained. Emphasis was laid on promoting local Tripura cuisine as an integral part of the visitor experience. It was further noted that the tourism circuit should also include a high-end, niche component, encouraging participation from major hospitality players. Niche and high-end part of the circuit should be blended with the mass circuit to exploit maximum benefit.

The Government has been working to strengthen real-time monitoring systems, early warning systems, and sensor-based technology to detect, monitor, and provide timely early warnings for all types of severe weather events. Major progress and achievements are given in Annexure-2. In recent years, the observational infrastructure and monitoring network over hilly regions has been significantly strengthened. In the western Himalayan States, Doppler Weather Radars (DWRs) have been installed at ten locations—Srinagar, Jammu, Banihal Top, Mukteshwar, Surkanda Devi, Lansdowne, Leh, Kufri, Jot, and Murari Devi. These radars are operational and support real-time monitoring and nowcasting (short-range forecasts of a few hours) of various extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall and snowfall. DWR observations are available every ten minutes in the form of cloud imagery and wind velocity measurements within the radar's coverage area. These observations support continuous monitoring and enable the issuance of nowcasts of heavy rainfall spells within short time frames (up to one hour). A new Central Sector Scheme \"Mission Mausam\" has been also launched by MoES to further strengthen and upgrade the observational network for monitoring and forecasting severe weather events, with the goal of making Bharat a \"Weather-ready and Climate- smart\" nation with IMD as a major player. ***** NKR/AK Annexure-1 The list of districts vulnerable to various weather-related hazards: State Name Districts Hazards HIMACHAL PRADESH BILASPUR, UNA, SIRMAUR, HAMIRPUR, SOLAN, MANDI, KANGRA, KULLU, CHAMBA, SHIMLA KINNAUR, LAHUL & SPITI Snowfall events JAMMU AND KASHMIR (UT) MUZAFFARABAD, MIRPUR, SAMBA, KATHUA, JAMMU, REASI, UDHAMPUR, RAJOURI BADGAM, KULGAM, DODA, SHUPIYAN, KISHTWAR, PULWAMA, PUNCH, GANDERBAL, BANDIPORE, RAMBAN, ANANTNAG, SRINAGAR, BARAMULA, KUPWARA UTTARAKHAND UDHAM SINGH NAGAR, NAINITAL, CHAMPAWAT, BAGESHWAR, UTTARKASHI, PITHORAGARH, HARIDWAR, TEHRI GARHWAL, RUDRAPRAYAG, ALMORA, PAURI GARHWAL, CHAMOLI, DEHRADUN HIMACHAL PRADESH BILASPUR, UNA, SIRMAUR, HAMIRPUR, SOLAN, MANDI, KANGRA, KULLU, CHAMBA, SHIMLA, KINNAUR, LAHUL & SPITI Cold Wave JAMMU AND KASHMIR (UT) KUPWARA,           BANDIPORE,                                 BARAMULA, GANDERBAL, ANANTNAG, KISHTWAR, SRINAGAR, BADGAM, PULWAMA, PUNCH, SHUPIYAN, KULGAM, RAJOURI, RAMBAN, REASI, DODA, JAMMU, KATHUA, UDHAMPUR, SAMBA, MUZAFFARABAD, MIRPUR UTTARAKHAND ALMORA, BAGESHWAR, CHAMOLI, CHAMPAWAT, DEHRADUN, HARIDWAR, NAINITAL, PAURI GARHWAL, PITHORAGARH, RUDRAPRAYAG, TEHRI GARHWAL, UDHAM SINGH NAGAR, UTTARKASHI HIMACHAL PRADESH BILASPUR, UNA, SIRMAUR, HAMIRPUR, SOLAN, MANDI, KANGRA, KULLU, CHAMBA, SHIMLA, KINNAUR, LAHUL & SPITI Thunderst orm JAMMU AND KASHMIR (UT) KATHUA,          KUPWARA,                            MUZAFFARABAD, KISHTWAR, BANDIPORE, MIRPUR, DODA, PUNCH, BARAMULA, UDHAMPUR, GANDERBAL, RAJOURI, BADGAM, SHUPIYAN, SRINAGAR, ANANTNAG, PULWAMA, REASI, KULGAM, RAMBAN, SAMBA, JAMMU UTTARAKHAND UDHAM SINGH NAGAR, PITHORAGARH, HARIDWAR, PAURI GARHWAL, CHAMPAWAT, BAGESHWAR, CHAMOLI, NAINITAL, ALMORA, RUDRAPRAYAG, UTTARKASHI, DEHRADUN, TEHRI GARHWAL HIMACHAL PRADESH BILASPUR,  UNA,   SIRMAUR,  HAMIRPUR,                   SOLAN, MANDI,         KANGRA,                      KULLU,       CHAMBA,                  SHIMLA, KINNAUR, LAHUL & SPITI Lightning JAMMU AND KASHMIR (UT) KUPWARA, RAJOURI, JAMMU, BARAMULA UTTARAKHA ND NAINITAL, PAURI, GARHWAL, UTTARKASHI, DEHRADUN, HARIDWAR, CHAMPAWAT, CHAMOLI, UDHAM SINGH NAGAR, ALMORA, RUDRAPRAYAG, BAGESHWAR, PITHORAGARH HIMACHAL PRADESH LAHUL & SPITI, BILASPUR, UNA, SIRMAUR, KINNAUR, CHAMBA, SOLAN,          HAMIRPUR,                      MANDI,   KULLU, KANGRA, SHIMLA Flood JAMMU AND KASHMIR (UT) KULGAM, BANDIPORE, SHUPIYAN, MUZAFFARABAD, GANDERBAL, KISHTWAR, KUPWARA, MIRPUR, SAMBA, BADGAM, RAMBAN, UDHAMPUR, ANANTNAG, KATHUA, RAJOURI, BARAMULA, PUNCH, PULWAMA, REASI, DODA, SRINAGAR, JAMMU UTTARAKHA ND BAGESHWAR,        HARIDWAR,                                  RUDRAPRAYAG, CHAMPAWAT, UDHAM SINGH NAGAR, ALMORA, DEHRADUN, NAINITAL, UTTARKASHI, PAURI, GARHWAL, TEHRI, GARHWAL, CHAMOLI, PITHORAGARH ANNEXURE-2 Major targets achieved in recent years by IMD are as follows: Expansion of the Doppler Weather Radar (DWR) network from 15 in 2014 to 47.

The National Climate Centre was created within this Office in 2005, which gained international responsibilities of a Regional Climate Centre for RA II (region South Asia) in 2010. The formal establishment of a specialized climate service by IMD was however started in 2017, when the Pune office was again re-designated as the Office of Climate Research and Services (CRS). Currently, the CRS office has been carrying out many India-specific climate-related activities like Climate Monitoring and Analysis, Climate Data Management, Climate Research, and Climate Prediction (Seasonal Forecasts). The CRS Office is bringing out climate diagnostic bulletins regularly, and different climate data products are prepared for the user community. Operational Seasonal forecasts for the country as well as South Asia is another important activity of this Office. CRS Office is also working as the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recognised Regional Climate Centre (RCC) for Pune since 2016 and the Global Production Centre (GPC) of Long-Range Forecasting since 2023. Recently, the IMD has also initiated the establishment of the National Framework for Climate Services (NFCS) in alignment with the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS) of the World Meteorological Organization. A stakeholder consultation workshop on the NFCS was organised by IMD on 5–6 October 2023 as a part of the implementation of the National Framework of Climate Services, which is supported by a broad network of collaborating institutions, including the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)/State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), State Governments, urban local bodies, and various research and academic organizations. During the workshop, participants from several ministries and user sectors unanimously agreed to establish a formal mechanism based on the NFCS concept, suitably adapted for the Indian context. This will strengthen responsibility-sharing and operational coordination among agencies serving climate-sensitive sectors. NFCS aims to develop and deliver tailored climate information and services to support decision-making in key climate-sensitive sectors. To further advance weather and climate services in India, IMD has also conducted multiple state-level stakeholder consultation workshops with various State Government departments. These engagements included users from agriculture, water resources, energy, disaster management, transport, aviation, media, health, urban planning, and local communities. The discussions helped identify practical gaps, emerging needs, and opportunities to improve the usability, accessibility, and reach of weather and climate services across the country. The weather and climate modelling systems implemented under the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) significantly contribute to improving forecasting capabilities across different time scales. Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, high-resolution regional models, and coupled ocean–atmosphere climate models enhance short-range to seasonal forecasting of rainfall, monsoon variability, cyclones, heatwaves, cold waves, and extreme weather events. Advanced data assimilation systems, supported by satellite and ground-based observations, improve the initial conditions of models, thereby enhancing forecast accuracy. The use of high-performance computing systems, ensemble prediction techniques, and impact-based forecasting frameworks has strengthened the country's ability to provide more reliable and actionable weather and climate forecasts to various sectors and user groups. There has been tremendous progress in modernising IMD's observational system with the installation of new Doppler Weather Radars (DWRs), lightning alert systems, and automated weather stations across the country. Presently, a total of 47 DWRs are installed and operational in India compared to 14 DWRs in 2014. There are 104 locations having a Lightning detection System across India, which are fully operational with lightning alert dissemination through the Damini App. Under the Mission Mausam, the Bharat Forecast System (BharatFS), an advanced computer simulation model, has already been developed, and it has been operational at a very high spatial resolution of 6 km. It also has the capability to provide predictions of rainfall events up to 10 days, covering the short and medium-range forecasts. Due to its higher resolution and improved dynamics, it generates weather forecasts at the panchayat or cluster of panchayats level. To further support the operations of high-resolution model simulations in real-time, the computing facilities (Arunika and Arka) have been substantially increased to integrate voluminous data and run meso-scale, regional, and global models. The India Meteorological Department has taken significant steps to enhance training, strengthen international cooperation, and expand awareness activities for improved climate and weather services. IMD actively collaborates with global and regional agencies—including WMO, WHO, UKMO, RIMES, UNESCAP, and all South Asian countries—to advance climate services in India and contribute to the regional climate services framework. IMD experts participate in several high-level international committees such as the WMO Task Team on the National Framework for Climate Services (TT-NFCS), the Climate Services Working Group of the South Asian Hydromet Forum (SAHF), and CLIVAR scientific panels, ensuring India's strong presence in global climate service development and international cooperation. Capacity building is further strengthened through numerous international training programmes conducted by IMD's Meteorological Training Institute (MTI), which regularly hosts participants from developing and neighbouring countries. These combined efforts are substantially contributing to more robust climate services, improved early warning capabilities, and better-informed decision-making across sectors in India. ***** NKR/AK (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205867) आगंतुक पटल  : 75 इस विज्ञप्ति को इन भाषाओं में पढ़ें: हिन्दी Ministry of Earth Sciences PARLIAMENT QUESTION: IMPROVING CLIMATE AND WEATHER SERVICES प्रविष्टि तिथि:\r\n                        18 DEC 2025 3:41PM by PIB Delhi India Meteorological Department (IMD) has been providing various climate-related services to the country since 1985, through its Pune Office.

Advanced data assimilation systems, supported by satellite and ground-based observations, improve the initial conditions of models, thereby enhancing forecast accuracy. The use of high-performance computing systems, ensemble prediction techniques, and impact-based forecasting frameworks has strengthened the country's ability to provide more reliable and actionable weather and climate forecasts to various sectors and user groups. There has been tremendous progress in modernising IMD's observational system with the installation of new Doppler Weather Radars (DWRs), lightning alert systems, and automated weather stations across the country. Presently, a total of 47 DWRs are installed and operational in India compared to 14 DWRs in 2014. There are 104 locations having a Lightning detection System across India, which are fully operational with lightning alert dissemination through the Damini App. Under the Mission Mausam, the Bharat Forecast System (BharatFS), an advanced computer simulation model, has already been developed, and it has been operational at a very high spatial resolution of 6 km. It also has the capability to provide predictions of rainfall events up to 10 days, covering the short and medium-range forecasts. Due to its higher resolution and improved dynamics, it generates weather forecasts at the panchayat or cluster of panchayats level. To further support the operations of high-resolution model simulations in real-time, the computing facilities (Arunika and Arka) have been substantially increased to integrate voluminous data and run meso-scale, regional, and global models. The India Meteorological Department has taken significant steps to enhance training, strengthen international cooperation, and expand awareness activities for improved climate and weather services. IMD actively collaborates with global and regional agencies—including WMO, WHO, UKMO, RIMES, UNESCAP, and all South Asian countries—to advance climate services in India and contribute to the regional climate services framework. IMD experts participate in several high-level international committees such as the WMO Task Team on the National Framework for Climate Services (TT-NFCS), the Climate Services Working Group of the South Asian Hydromet Forum (SAHF), and CLIVAR scientific panels, ensuring India's strong presence in global climate service development and international cooperation. Capacity building is further strengthened through numerous international training programmes conducted by IMD's Meteorological Training Institute (MTI), which regularly hosts participants from developing and neighbouring countries. These combined efforts are substantially contributing to more robust climate services, improved early warning capabilities, and better-informed decision-making across sectors in India. ***** NKR/AK (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205867)",

The actual season rainfall for the country as a whole was 108 % of LPA. Thus, the seasonal rainfall forecast for the country as a whole was correct. Considering the four broad geographical regions of India, the forecasts issued on 27th May 2024 indicated that the southwest monsoon seasonal (June to September 2024) rainfall is most likely to be above-normal over Central India and South Peninsular India (>106% of LPA), normal over Northwest India (92-108% of LPA) and below normal over Northeast India (<94% of LPA). The forecast for the southwest monsoon seasonal rainfall over the monsoon core zone, consisting of most of the rainfed agriculture, was also above Normal (>106% of LPA. The actual rainfall over Northwest India, Central India, Northeast India, South Peninsula, and Monsoon Core Zone was recorded at 107%, 120%, 86%, 114% and 119% of the LPA, respectively. The seasonal forecast issued for homogeneous regions during the season was within the range of the forecast for all four regions. The first stage forecast for the 2025 southwest monsoon season (June-September) rainfall over the country as a whole issued in April was 105% of LPA with a model error of ± 5% of LPA, and the update forecast issued at the end of 5th May 2025 was 106% of LPA with a model error of ± 4% of LPA. The actual season rainfall for the country as a whole was 108 % of LPA. Thus, the seasonal rainfall forecast for the country as a whole was correct.

The bill amends three Acts related to Insurance sector, namely, The Insurance Act,1938, The Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956 and The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority Act, 1999. One of the key features of the bill is to allow up to 100% Foreign Direct Investment in Insurance Companies, opening doors to more foreign players to India.  This will help in capital augmentation, adoption of advanced technology and bringing global best practices along with increasing employment opportunities.  Increased competition would drive efficiency in products and services proving beneficial for the citizens. Ease of Doing business is being promoted for intermediaries through the introduction of provision of one-time licensing and the provision of suspension of license rather than straight away cancellation. For insurers, the limit of seeking prior regulatory approval for transfer of share capital has been raised from 1% to 5%, the Net Owned Fund requirement of Foreign Reinsurance Branches has been reduced from Rs 5,000 Crore to Rs 1,000 Crore.  LIC has been provided autonomy to open Zonal offices in the country and to align its foreign offices with the laws and regulations of their respective jurisdiction. To protect the interest of Policyholders, a dedicated fund, namely Policyholders’ Education and Protection Fund will be set up to spread awareness about insurance. Policyholders’ data would now be required to be collected and protected in alignment with DPDP Act 2023. Regulatory governance is being strengthened by introducing standard operating procedure for regulation making and mandating the process consultative.  IRDAI is being given the power to disgorge wrongful gains from insurers and intermediaries.

The bill amends three Acts related to Insurance sector, namely, The Insurance Act,1938, The Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956 and The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority Act, 1999. One of the key features of the bill is to allow up to 100% Foreign Direct Investment in Insurance Companies, opening doors to more foreign players to India.  This will help in capital augmentation, adoption of advanced technology and bringing global best practices along with increasing employment opportunities.  Increased competition would drive efficiency in products and services proving beneficial for the citizens. Ease of Doing business is being promoted for intermediaries through the introduction of provision of one-time licensing and the provision of suspension of license rather than straight away cancellation. For insurers, the limit of seeking prior regulatory approval for transfer of share capital has been raised from 1% to 5%, the Net Owned Fund requirement of Foreign Reinsurance Branches has been reduced from Rs 5,000 Crore to Rs 1,000 Crore.  LIC has been provided autonomy to open Zonal offices in the country and to align its foreign offices with the laws and regulations of their respective jurisdiction. To protect the interest of Policyholders, a dedicated fund, namely Policyholders’ Education and Protection Fund will be set up to spread awareness about insurance. Policyholders’ data would now be required to be collected and protected in alignment with DPDP Act 2023. Regulatory governance is being strengthened by introducing standard operating procedure for regulation making and mandating the process consultative.  IRDAI is being given the power to disgorge wrongful gains from insurers and intermediaries. Penalties are being rationalised and factors for imposition of penalties are being introduced. The reforms are aimed at extending insurance coverage to people, households and enterprises, deepening insurance coverage, providing ease of doing business, improving regulatory oversight and governance. All these measures would lead to strengthening of Indian insurance sector to provide financial resilience to Indian economy. ***** NB/PK (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2206011)",

The Central Government supplements the measures and efforts being taken up by the State Governments. The Government of India takes various initiatives on water conservation to ensure the long-term sustainability of water conservation. Major steps taken by the Government for water conservation and rainwater harvesting across the country including the states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and UT of Dadra and Nagar Haveli: The Ministry of Jal Shakti has been implementing Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) since 2019 across the country including the states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and UT of Dadra and Nagar Haveli. JSA: CTR has become a regular feature since 2021, with its sixth edition is implemented in all the districts (rural as well as urban) of the country from 22.03.2025 to 30.11.2025 under the theme “Jal Sanchay, Jan Bhagidari: Jan Jagrukta Ki Or”, emphasizing community participation and water conservation awareness. The campaign emphasizes convergent financing from various schemes of the Central, State and local bodies like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), Per Drop More Crop, Repair, Renovation and Restoration Components under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY), Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA), Finance Commission grants etc. Under the Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain (JSA: CTR) campaign, Khandwa district has completed more than 7,000 water conservation and water-related works during the last three years. The district has also established a Jal Shakti Kendra and prepared a District Water Conservation Plan. Further, the district wise details of the water conservation initiatives undertaken under the Jal Shakti Abhiyan in the states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and UT of Dadra and Nagar Haveli during the last three years are given at Annexures I, II and III respectively. To further deepen public involvement, \"Jal Sanchay Jan Bhagidari\" (JSJB) initiative was launched in Surat, Gujarat on 6th September 2024. This initiative encourages collective action by communities, civil society, and local governments to implement low-cost, locally appropriate water conservation solutions under a whole-of-society and whole-of-government approach. More than 1.48 lakhs works are completed under the JSJB initiative in the Khandwa district. To ensure effective implementation of the campaign, State Nodal Officers (SNOs) and District Nodal Officers (DNOs) have been appointed at the State and District levels, respectively, to monitor progress and to provide technical assistance. Besides, meetings are conducted with SNOs, Municipal Commissioners, District Magistrates (DMs)/ Deputy Commissioners (DCs), Partner Central Ministries/Departments, Central Nodal Officers (CNOs) and other stakeholders concerned to provide necessary support and gather feedback. Apart from the above, the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), in consultation with State Governments, assesses the country’s dynamic groundwater resources annually. These periodic estimations offer crucial insights into groundwater replenishment, utilization and overall availability across all assessment units, aiding various stakeholders in informed decision-making. Furthermore, Jal Shakti Kendras (JSKs) have been established, serving as dedicated resource and knowledge centers to provide technical guidance to locals and support district administration in implementation of rain water harvesting systems. In addition, District Water Conservation Plans have been formulated to ensure sustainable water management. The progress is also monitored through online portals such as JSA: CTR (https://jsactr.mowr.gov.in/) and JSJB ( https://jsactr.mowr.gov.in/JSJB/ ). Also, Government of India has been implementing a scheme namely Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) across the country which inter-alia includes water conservation and water harvesting structures. Financial assistance is given to various States under 15th Finance Commission tied grants which can be inter-alia utilized for rainwater harvesting. Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) has provisions for harvesting the rainwater through storm water drains into water body (which is not receiving sewage/effluent). Through preparation of ‘Aquifer Management Plan’ cities targets to strategize groundwater recharge augmentation by developing a roadmap for improving rain water harvesting within city limits. Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs formulated guidelines for the States to adopt measures suitable to local conditions, such as Unified Building Bye Laws (UBBL) of Delhi, 2016, Model Building Bye Laws (MBBL), 2016 and Urban and Regional Development Plan Formulation and Implementation (URDPFI) Guidelines, 2014 with adequate focus on requirement of rainwater harvesting and water conservation measures. Government of India is implementing “Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY)” with an aim to enhance physical access of water on farm and expand cultivable area under assured irrigation, improve on farm water use efficiency, introduce sustainable water conservation practices etc. PMKSY has three components/ schemes namely Har Khet Ko Pani (HKKP), Repair, Renovation & Restoration (RRR) Scheme of Water Bodies and Surface Minor irrigation (SMI) Scheme. National Water Policy (2012) has been formulated by Department of Water Resources, RD & GR, which inter-alia advocates rainwater harvesting and conservation of water and also highlights the need for augmenting the availability of water through direct use of rainfall. Department of Land Resources (DoLR) implements Watershed Development Component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (WDC-PMKSY) for the development of rainfed and degraded lands in the country. The activities undertaken, inter-alia, include ridge area treatment, drainage line treatment, soil and moisture conservation, rainwater harvesting, nursery raising, pasture development, livelihoods for asset-less persons etc. WDC-PMKSY, through these interventions, seeks to ensure sustainable development through improved natural resource management and better resilience of farmers to climate change Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) implements a Central Sector Scheme “Ground Water Management and Regulation (GWMR)” for providing scientific information for ground water management. The scheme is implemented throughout the country including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and the UT of Dadra & Nagar Haveli. Major activities taken up under the scheme includes aquifer mapping and other routine activities of CGWB such as ground water level and quality monitoring, assessment of dynamic ground water resources, strengthening of scientific infrastructure for technological upgradation, various outreach activities to promote water conservation and sustainable use etc. Central Ground Water Board has completed the National Aquifer Mapping Project in the entire mappable area of about 25 Lakh sq. km in the Country including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and UT of Dadra and Nagar Haveli. As per the Dynamic Ground Water Resources Assessments (DGWRA), the Stage of Ground Water Extraction in the district of Khandwa has improved from 41.48% in 2023 to 39.78% in 2025.

The Central Government supplements the measures and efforts being taken up by the State Governments. The Government of India takes various initiatives on water conservation to ensure the long-term sustainability of water conservation. Major steps taken by the Government for water conservation and rainwater harvesting across the country including the states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and UT of Dadra and Nagar Haveli: The Ministry of Jal Shakti has been implementing Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) since 2019 across the country including the states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and UT of Dadra and Nagar Haveli. JSA: CTR has become a regular feature since 2021, with its sixth edition is implemented in all the districts (rural as well as urban) of the country from 22.03.2025 to 30.11.2025 under the theme “Jal Sanchay, Jan Bhagidari: Jan Jagrukta Ki Or”, emphasizing community participation and water conservation awareness. The campaign emphasizes convergent financing from various schemes of the Central, State and local bodies like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), Per Drop More Crop, Repair, Renovation and Restoration Components under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY), Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA), Finance Commission grants etc. Under the Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain (JSA: CTR) campaign, Khandwa district has completed more than 7,000 water conservation and water-related works during the last three years. The district has also established a Jal Shakti Kendra and prepared a District Water Conservation Plan. Further, the district wise details of the water conservation initiatives undertaken under the Jal Shakti Abhiyan in the states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and UT of Dadra and Nagar Haveli during the last three years are given at Annexures I, II and III respectively. To further deepen public involvement, \"Jal Sanchay Jan Bhagidari\" (JSJB) initiative was launched in Surat, Gujarat on 6th September 2024. This initiative encourages collective action by communities, civil society, and local governments to implement low-cost, locally appropriate water conservation solutions under a whole-of-society and whole-of-government approach. More than 1.48 lakhs works are completed under the JSJB initiative in the Khandwa district. To ensure effective implementation of the campaign, State Nodal Officers (SNOs) and District Nodal Officers (DNOs) have been appointed at the State and District levels, respectively, to monitor progress and to provide technical assistance. Besides, meetings are conducted with SNOs, Municipal Commissioners, District Magistrates (DMs)/ Deputy Commissioners (DCs), Partner Central Ministries/Departments, Central Nodal Officers (CNOs) and other stakeholders concerned to provide necessary support and gather feedback. Apart from the above, the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), in consultation with State Governments, assesses the country’s dynamic groundwater resources annually. These periodic estimations offer crucial insights into groundwater replenishment, utilization and overall availability across all assessment units, aiding various stakeholders in informed decision-making. Furthermore, Jal Shakti Kendras (JSKs) have been established, serving as dedicated resource and knowledge centers to provide technical guidance to locals and support district administration in implementation of rain water harvesting systems. In addition, District Water Conservation Plans have been formulated to ensure sustainable water management. The progress is also monitored through online portals such as JSA: CTR (https://jsactr.mowr.gov.in/) and JSJB ( https://jsactr.mowr.gov.in/JSJB/ ). Also, Government of India has been implementing a scheme namely Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) across the country which inter-alia includes water conservation and water harvesting structures. Financial assistance is given to various States under 15th Finance Commission tied grants which can be inter-alia utilized for rainwater harvesting. Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) has provisions for harvesting the rainwater through storm water drains into water body (which is not receiving sewage/effluent). Through preparation of ‘Aquifer Management Plan’ cities targets to strategize groundwater recharge augmentation by developing a roadmap for improving rain water harvesting within city limits. Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs formulated guidelines for the States to adopt measures suitable to local conditions, such as Unified Building Bye Laws (UBBL) of Delhi, 2016, Model Building Bye Laws (MBBL), 2016 and Urban and Regional Development Plan Formulation and Implementation (URDPFI) Guidelines, 2014 with adequate focus on requirement of rainwater harvesting and water conservation measures. Government of India is implementing “Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY)” with an aim to enhance physical access of water on farm and expand cultivable area under assured irrigation, improve on farm water use efficiency, introduce sustainable water conservation practices etc. PMKSY has three components/ schemes namely Har Khet Ko Pani (HKKP), Repair, Renovation & Restoration (RRR) Scheme of Water Bodies and Surface Minor irrigation (SMI) Scheme. National Water Policy (2012) has been formulated by Department of Water Resources, RD & GR, which inter-alia advocates rainwater harvesting and conservation of water and also highlights the need for augmenting the availability of water through direct use of rainfall. Department of Land Resources (DoLR) implements Watershed Development Component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (WDC-PMKSY) for the development of rainfed and degraded lands in the country. The activities undertaken, inter-alia, include ridge area treatment, drainage line treatment, soil and moisture conservation, rainwater harvesting, nursery raising, pasture development, livelihoods for asset-less persons etc. WDC-PMKSY, through these interventions, seeks to ensure sustainable development through improved natural resource management and better resilience of farmers to climate change Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) implements a Central Sector Scheme “Ground Water Management and Regulation (GWMR)” for providing scientific information for ground water management. The scheme is implemented throughout the country including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and the UT of Dadra & Nagar Haveli. Major activities taken up under the scheme includes aquifer mapping and other routine activities of CGWB such as ground water level and quality monitoring, assessment of dynamic ground water resources, strengthening of scientific infrastructure for technological upgradation, various outreach activities to promote water conservation and sustainable use etc. Central Ground Water Board has completed the National Aquifer Mapping Project in the entire mappable area of about 25 Lakh sq. km in the Country including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and UT of Dadra and Nagar Haveli. As per the Dynamic Ground Water Resources Assessments (DGWRA), the Stage of Ground Water Extraction in the district of Khandwa has improved from 41.48% in 2023 to 39.78% in 2025. The district-wise details of DGWRA 2025 for Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and UT of Dadar and Nagar Haveli, are given in Annexure IV, V and VI respectively.

As per the 2025 assessment, the total Annual Ground Water Recharge in the country is 448.52 Billion Cubic Meter (BCM) and the Annual Extractable Ground Water Resources is estimated as 407.75 BCM. The Further, total Annual Ground Water Extraction of the entire country for the year 2025 has been assessed as 247.22 BCM. Based on this, the Stage of Ground Water Extraction (SoE), which is a measure of Annual Ground Water Extraction for all uses (irrigation, industrial and domestic uses) over Annual Extractable Ground Water Resource is worked out to be 60.63% for the country as a whole . Regarding categorization of units in terms of their stage of ground water extraction, out of the total 6762 Assessment Units (Blocks/Taluks/Mandals) in the country, 730 (10.80%) units have been categorized as ‘Over- exploited’ indicating ground water extraction exceeding the annually replenishable ground water recharge. Further, 201 units (2.97 %) have been categorized as ‘Critical’, 758 units (11.21 %) as ‘Semi-critical’ and 4946 units (73.14 %) are in ‘Safe’ category. Additionally, 127 assessment units (1.88%) are categorized as ‘saline’. State/UT-wise details are provided in Annexure -I. Further, the District-Wise Ground Water Resources for all the states, including Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Odisha can be seen in the National Compilation of Dynamic Ground Water Resources of India, 2025 which can be accessed at: https://cgwb.gov.in/cgwbpnm/download/1741#page=171 Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) generates ground water quality data of the country on a regional scale as part of its ground water quality monitoring program and various scientific studies conducted as per the approved Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). Overall, the data on ground water quality indicates that the ground water in the country remains largely potable with localized occurrences of contaminants in isolated pockets. State-wise distribution of major pollutants such as Arsenic, Fluoride, Nitrate and heavy metals, as per the Annual Ground Water Quality Report – 2025 can be viewed through the web link provided below: https://cgwb.gov.in/cgwbpnm/public/uploads/documents/1764833633531847433file.pdf Efforts of the Central government towards ground water monitoring, aquifer mapping and recharge along with spreading community awareness, are mainly channeled through the schemes/programmes like Ground Water Management & Regulation (GWM &R) Scheme, Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA), Jal Sanchay Jan Bhagidari (JSJB), Atal Bhujal Yojana etc. GWM &R is a central sector scheme under which funds are not disbursed to states but rather are completely allocated and spent by CGWB for the purpose of ground water monitoring, mapping and regulation. Further, JSA and JSJB take up large scale construction/rejuvenation of artificial recharge/rain water harvesting works through convergence with ongoing central and state schemes and no separate funds are allotted for this purpose. As per the available data on JSA dashboard, an expenditure of approximately Rs. 1.5 lakh cr has been incurred towards this since 2021 through convergence with MGNREGS alone. NAQUIM studies have been taken up across the country by the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) for delineation and characterisation of aquifers and preparation of plans for ground water management. NAQUIM was initiated as a part of the ‘Ground Water Management and Regulation’ scheme and the entire mappable area of the country of about 25 lakh sq. kms has been mapped. State wise details of coverage area under NAQUIM is presented in Annexure -II. Further, ground water management studies/ plans have been prepared for the entire targeted area across the country covering all the 14 Principal aquifers and 42 major aquifers and District-wise aquifer maps and management plans for 654 Districts of the country, which include both supply side and demand side measures for sustainable management of ground water resources, have been shared with the concerned State/District administrations for taking up suitable field interventions. Moreover, Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater- 2020 has been prepared by the CGWB and shared with States/UTs providing a broad outline for construction of around 1.42 crore rain water harvesting and artificial recharge structures in the country with estimated cost, which has a potential to harness around 185 BCM (Billion cubic meter) of water. The Ministry of Jal Shakti is currently conducting stakeholder consultations for assessing the ground water extraction Guidelines. ‘Water’ being a State subject, sustainable development and management of groundwater resources and address contamination issues is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments. The Central Government, on its part, facilitates the efforts of the State Governments by way of technical and financial assistance through its various schemes and projects. The major steps taken by the government in this direction, for improving ground water conservation and recharge, regulating over-extraction, mitigation of contamination and saltwater intrusion and ensuring long term sustainability of the resource in the country, along with their impact, are provided below: Efforts of the Central government for augmenting the water/groundwater resources of the country, are mainly channeled through the flagship campaign of Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA). JSA is a time bound and mission mode programme being conducted annually since 2019 by the M/o Jal Shakti, wherein all the efforts and funds under various schemes and projects are converged to deliver water harvesting and artificial recharge works on the ground. Currently, JSA 2025 is underway in the country with special focus on over-exploited and critical districts. As per the available information, under JSA, completion of around 1.21 crore water conservation and artificial recharge works has been coordinated through convergence in the country in the last 4 years, which has played a key role in enhancing the sustainability of ground water resources. To further strengthen the momentum of Jal Shakti Abhiyan, Jal Sanchay Jan Bhagidari (JSJB): A Community-Driven Path to Water Sustainability in India has been launched by the Hon’ble Prime Minister with a vision to make rain water harvesting a mass movement in the country. By promoting community ownership and responsibility, the initiative seeks to develop cost-eﬀective, local solutions tailored to speciﬁc water challenges across diﬀerent regions. M/o Jal Shakti has constituted the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) for the purpose of regulation and control of ground water extraction in the Country and has notified Guidelines dated 24.09.2020 for the purpose of such regulation, which have pan India applicability. Additionally, stringent measures like imposition of heavy penalties & Environmental Compensation Charges (EC) extraction without valid NOC, prohibiting new large-scale industries in over-exploited areas, sealing of bore wells for illegal extraction etc. have been mandated by the Guidelines to regulate over extraction. M/o Jal Shakti has successfully demonstrated the efficacy of community led participatory ground water management through Atal Bhujal Yojana, which was implemented in 80 water stressed districts in 7 States, viz. Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Construction/rejuvenation of more than 83,000 rain water harvesting and recharge structures like check dams, ponds, shafts etc. was completed under the scheme and more than 9 lakh Ha area was brought under efficient irrigation practices. Mission Amrit Sarovar was launched by the Government of India which aimed at developing and rejuvenating at least 75 water bodies in each district of the country. As an outcome nearly 69,000 Amrit Sarovars have been constructed/rejuvenated in the country, leading to enhanced water storage and ground water recharge. In addition to conducting extensive aquifer mapping activities throughout the country, CGWB has also prepared the Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater- 2020, which is a macro level plan indicating various structures for the different terrain conditions of the country for serving as a technical guide for construction of artificial recharge and rain water harvesting structures. Regarding ground water quality aspect, CGWB regularly monitors ground water quality samples throughout the country as per its SOP and issues Annual reports, Half-yearly Bulletins and fortnightly alerts regarding its findings for quick action by stakeholders; Technique for constructing Arsenic and Fluoride safe wells has also been developed by CGWB and guidance is provided to states for replication and upscaling; Further, the Government is also implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) in partnership with states for providing safe and adequate drinking water to all rural households of the country. Various organizations under this Ministry like National Institute of Hydrology (NIH), CGWB, Central Water Commission (CWC) etc. have conducted independent studies in various parts of the country affected by salinity ingress and saltwater intrusion and made several recommendations like construction of embankments, sea walls, inlet control mechanism at creeks etc. In order to assess the impact of various water conservation interventions on ground water level in the last five years, the post-monsoon 2024 State/UT-wise water level data for the country is compared with the Mean of the previous 5 years (post-monsoon water level data from 2019-23), which is provided in Annexure-III . Such analysis indicates that in the country as a whole, about 54.4 % of analyzed wells showed rising water levels in 2024 as compared to the mean level of previous 5 years. Further, similar analysis for Palghar district (Maharashtra), Nabarangpur district (Odisha) and Pali Lok Sabha Constituency in Rajasthan (covering Pali & Jodhpur Districts) is presented in Annexure -IV, which indicates that in Palghar District of Maharashtra 80% analyzed wells have shown rise in 2024 as compared with the mean of previous 5 years, in Nabarangpur district of Odisha, 25% of wells and have shown rise and in Jodhpur & Pali districts under Pali Lok Sabha Constituency, respectively 68.9% & 81.25% of wells have shown rising trends .

As per the 2025 assessment, the total Annual Ground Water Recharge in the country is 448.52 Billion Cubic Meter (BCM) and the Annual Extractable Ground Water Resources is estimated as 407.75 BCM. The Further, total Annual Ground Water Extraction of the entire country for the year 2025 has been assessed as 247.22 BCM. Based on this, the Stage of Ground Water Extraction (SoE), which is a measure of Annual Ground Water Extraction for all uses (irrigation, industrial and domestic uses) over Annual Extractable Ground Water Resource is worked out to be 60.63% for the country as a whole . Regarding categorization of units in terms of their stage of ground water extraction, out of the total 6762 Assessment Units (Blocks/Taluks/Mandals) in the country, 730 (10.80%) units have been categorized as ‘Over- exploited’ indicating ground water extraction exceeding the annually replenishable ground water recharge. Further, 201 units (2.97 %) have been categorized as ‘Critical’, 758 units (11.21 %) as ‘Semi-critical’ and 4946 units (73.14 %) are in ‘Safe’ category. Additionally, 127 assessment units (1.88%) are categorized as ‘saline’. State/UT-wise details are provided in Annexure -I. Further, the District-Wise Ground Water Resources for all the states, including Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Odisha can be seen in the National Compilation of Dynamic Ground Water Resources of India, 2025 which can be accessed at: https://cgwb.gov.in/cgwbpnm/download/1741#page=171 Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) generates ground water quality data of the country on a regional scale as part of its ground water quality monitoring program and various scientific studies conducted as per the approved Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). Overall, the data on ground water quality indicates that the ground water in the country remains largely potable with localized occurrences of contaminants in isolated pockets. State-wise distribution of major pollutants such as Arsenic, Fluoride, Nitrate and heavy metals, as per the Annual Ground Water Quality Report – 2025 can be viewed through the web link provided below: https://cgwb.gov.in/cgwbpnm/public/uploads/documents/1764833633531847433file.pdf Efforts of the Central government towards ground water monitoring, aquifer mapping and recharge along with spreading community awareness, are mainly channeled through the schemes/programmes like Ground Water Management & Regulation (GWM &R) Scheme, Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA), Jal Sanchay Jan Bhagidari (JSJB), Atal Bhujal Yojana etc. GWM &R is a central sector scheme under which funds are not disbursed to states but rather are completely allocated and spent by CGWB for the purpose of ground water monitoring, mapping and regulation. Further, JSA and JSJB take up large scale construction/rejuvenation of artificial recharge/rain water harvesting works through convergence with ongoing central and state schemes and no separate funds are allotted for this purpose. As per the available data on JSA dashboard, an expenditure of approximately Rs. 1.5 lakh cr has been incurred towards this since 2021 through convergence with MGNREGS alone. NAQUIM studies have been taken up across the country by the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) for delineation and characterisation of aquifers and preparation of plans for ground water management. NAQUIM was initiated as a part of the ‘Ground Water Management and Regulation’ scheme and the entire mappable area of the country of about 25 lakh sq. kms has been mapped. State wise details of coverage area under NAQUIM is presented in Annexure -II. Further, ground water management studies/ plans have been prepared for the entire targeted area across the country covering all the 14 Principal aquifers and 42 major aquifers and District-wise aquifer maps and management plans for 654 Districts of the country, which include both supply side and demand side measures for sustainable management of ground water resources, have been shared with the concerned State/District administrations for taking up suitable field interventions. Moreover, Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater- 2020 has been prepared by the CGWB and shared with States/UTs providing a broad outline for construction of around 1.42 crore rain water harvesting and artificial recharge structures in the country with estimated cost, which has a potential to harness around 185 BCM (Billion cubic meter) of water. The Ministry of Jal Shakti is currently conducting stakeholder consultations for assessing the ground water extraction Guidelines. ‘Water’ being a State subject, sustainable development and management of groundwater resources and address contamination issues is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments. The Central Government, on its part, facilitates the efforts of the State Governments by way of technical and financial assistance through its various schemes and projects. The major steps taken by the government in this direction, for improving ground water conservation and recharge, regulating over-extraction, mitigation of contamination and saltwater intrusion and ensuring long term sustainability of the resource in the country, along with their impact, are provided below: Efforts of the Central government for augmenting the water/groundwater resources of the country, are mainly channeled through the flagship campaign of Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA). JSA is a time bound and mission mode programme being conducted annually since 2019 by the M/o Jal Shakti, wherein all the efforts and funds under various schemes and projects are converged to deliver water harvesting and artificial recharge works on the ground. Currently, JSA 2025 is underway in the country with special focus on over-exploited and critical districts. As per the available information, under JSA, completion of around 1.21 crore water conservation and artificial recharge works has been coordinated through convergence in the country in the last 4 years, which has played a key role in enhancing the sustainability of ground water resources. To further strengthen the momentum of Jal Shakti Abhiyan, Jal Sanchay Jan Bhagidari (JSJB): A Community-Driven Path to Water Sustainability in India has been launched by the Hon’ble Prime Minister with a vision to make rain water harvesting a mass movement in the country. By promoting community ownership and responsibility, the initiative seeks to develop cost-eﬀective, local solutions tailored to speciﬁc water challenges across diﬀerent regions. M/o Jal Shakti has constituted the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) for the purpose of regulation and control of ground water extraction in the Country and has notified Guidelines dated 24.09.2020 for the purpose of such regulation, which have pan India applicability. Additionally, stringent measures like imposition of heavy penalties & Environmental Compensation Charges (EC) extraction without valid NOC, prohibiting new large-scale industries in over-exploited areas, sealing of bore wells for illegal extraction etc. have been mandated by the Guidelines to regulate over extraction. M/o Jal Shakti has successfully demonstrated the efficacy of community led participatory ground water management through Atal Bhujal Yojana, which was implemented in 80 water stressed districts in 7 States, viz. Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Construction/rejuvenation of more than 83,000 rain water harvesting and recharge structures like check dams, ponds, shafts etc. was completed under the scheme and more than 9 lakh Ha area was brought under efficient irrigation practices. Mission Amrit Sarovar was launched by the Government of India which aimed at developing and rejuvenating at least 75 water bodies in each district of the country. As an outcome nearly 69,000 Amrit Sarovars have been constructed/rejuvenated in the country, leading to enhanced water storage and ground water recharge. In addition to conducting extensive aquifer mapping activities throughout the country, CGWB has also prepared the Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater- 2020, which is a macro level plan indicating various structures for the different terrain conditions of the country for serving as a technical guide for construction of artificial recharge and rain water harvesting structures. Regarding ground water quality aspect, CGWB regularly monitors ground water quality samples throughout the country as per its SOP and issues Annual reports, Half-yearly Bulletins and fortnightly alerts regarding its findings for quick action by stakeholders; Technique for constructing Arsenic and Fluoride safe wells has also been developed by CGWB and guidance is provided to states for replication and upscaling; Further, the Government is also implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) in partnership with states for providing safe and adequate drinking water to all rural households of the country. Various organizations under this Ministry like National Institute of Hydrology (NIH), CGWB, Central Water Commission (CWC) etc. have conducted independent studies in various parts of the country affected by salinity ingress and saltwater intrusion and made several recommendations like construction of embankments, sea walls, inlet control mechanism at creeks etc. In order to assess the impact of various water conservation interventions on ground water level in the last five years, the post-monsoon 2024 State/UT-wise water level data for the country is compared with the Mean of the previous 5 years (post-monsoon water level data from 2019-23), which is provided in Annexure-III . Such analysis indicates that in the country as a whole, about 54.4 % of analyzed wells showed rising water levels in 2024 as compared to the mean level of previous 5 years. Further, similar analysis for Palghar district (Maharashtra), Nabarangpur district (Odisha) and Pali Lok Sabha Constituency in Rajasthan (covering Pali & Jodhpur Districts) is presented in Annexure -IV, which indicates that in Palghar District of Maharashtra 80% analyzed wells have shown rise in 2024 as compared with the mean of previous 5 years, in Nabarangpur district of Odisha, 25% of wells and have shown rise and in Jodhpur & Pali districts under Pali Lok Sabha Constituency, respectively 68.9% & 81.25% of wells have shown rising trends .

The project will be implemented across 20 States and will cover 81 disaster-prone districts with 20 Gram Panchayats each, while additionally also developing 20 Gram Panchayats focused on major hazard-specific risks as replicable models for local-level Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). The initiative seeks to integrate disaster risk reduction into local governance through a bottom-up approach, positioning Panchayati Raj Institutions as the backbone of disaster preparedness, mitigation and resilience at the grassroots level. These Model Gram Panchayats will serve as demonstrative templates for integrating disaster resilience into planning, infrastructure and community preparedness. ( For more information ) The project encompasses institutional strengthening and policy integration of DRR in development planning by PRIs, extensive capacity building and awareness generation for State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs), District Disaster Management Authorities (DDMAs), and elected representatives and functionaries of Panchayats, supported by targeted Information, Education and Communication (IEC) initiatives. It also focuses on fostering inter-institutional coordination among local, district, and state-level stakeholders to enable effective and sustained disaster mitigation. The Ministry of Panchayati Raj will leverage its digital platforms, including eGramSwaraj, Gram Manchitra etc., to integrate disaster management planning, track expenditures, and disseminate real-time information to Panchayats. Extensive capacity-building programmes will be undertaken for elected representatives of Panchayats, Panchayat functionaries, master trainers, and community volunteers, ensuring sustained institutional capability at the grassroots. Together, MoPR and NDMA, in close coordination with States and Panchayats, are laying the foundation for a resilient rural India, where empowered local institutions and informed communities play a central role in safeguarding lives, livelihoods, and infrastructure against disasters. 1 Model Village in each State (*Model Village to be decided by the States): S/N States Amount in Crore Hazard 1 Himachal Pradesh 5 Flash Flood / Landslide 2 Uttarakhand 5 Flash Flood / Landslide 3 Kerala 5 Ecosystem-Based Mitigation/Coastal Erosion 4 Odisha 5 Cyclone / Drought 5 Arunachal Pradesh 5 Flash Flood / Landslide 6 Sikkim 5 Ecosystem-Based Mitigation/ landslide 7 Assam 5 Flood / Ecosystem based Mitigation 8 Meghalaya 5 Landslide / Flood 9 Maharashtra 5 Drought / Earthquake 10 Rajasthan 5 Drought / Flood 11 Uttar Pradesh 5 Earthquake/ Flood 12 Tamil Nadu 5 Cyclone / Drought 13 Andhra Pradesh 5 Cyclone / landslide 14 Punjab 5 Earthquake / River Erosion 15 Bihar 5 Earthquake / Flood 16 Nagaland 5 Ecosystem-Based Mitigation/ landslide 17 Karnataka 5 Drought/Landslide 18 Mizoram 5 Flash Flood / Landslide 19 Tripura 5 Flood / Earthquake 20 Gujarat 5 Earthquake/Flood Total 100 An innovative concept of Model Gram Panchayat has been incorporated in this program. There will be one model Gram Panchayat (GP) for each of 20 States. Therefore, 20 Model Gram Panchayats will be identified by States exclusively for six different hazards (one GP for each hazard) themes for implementation of a long-term mitigation strategy for an end-to-end model to showcase the effectiveness of long-lasting mitigation measures on disaster proofing. The learnings in the identified 20 Gram Panchayats can be scaled up by the States through their SDMF for replicating as a disaster-resilient Gram Panchayat model for other Gram Panchayats. Depending on the size of the State and intensity of the disasters, the number of Districts has been taken.

The conclave, themed “Shaping India’s Growth Story through DAKSH PSEs @2047”, brought together senior leadership from Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs), Central Ministries, and key institutional stakeholders. The conclave was convened with the objective of developing a shared and structured CPSEs’ Capacity Building Roadmap, aligned with Mission Karmayogi—India’s National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building. It sought to integrate principles of good governance into CPSEs’ human capital strategies, strengthen leadership and succession planning, and promote inter-CPSE collaboration to support the national vision of Viksit Bharat @2047. The programme was steered by Dr. Alka Mittal, Member (Administration), Capacity Building Commission. While setting the context of the Conclave, Dr Mittal underscored the strategic role of CPSEs as critical institutions for nation-building beyond their commercial mandate. She highlighted that CPSEs are not only engines of economic growth, but also custodians of public values, governance standards, and long-term institutional capability. Ms. S. Radha Chauhan, Chairperson, Capacity Building Commission, highlighted the importance of embedding competency-based governance, leadership development, and performance-linked learning within CPSEs as part of India’s broader civil services reform agenda. She emphasised upon de-siloization of governance and democratization of learning. The ethos of Karmayogi should imbibe in every delivery of public service, she said. The inaugural address was delivered by Shri K Moses Chalai, Secretary, Department of Public Enterprises, who highlighted the fact that leadership is very important and we need visionary leaders. He later added that we should be open to change and adopt good changes. Members of the Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) Shri Alkesh Kumar Sharma and Shri Roop Narayan Sunkar also shared their key observations. A strategic keynote session was delivered by Dr. C. Jayakumar, Executive Vice President & Head, Corporate Human Resources, Larsen & Toubro (L&T) Ltd on “HR Strategies for Purpose-Driven Leadership”, focusing on building resilient leadership pipelines and aligning organisational values with national priorities. This was followed by a presentation on DAKSH (Development of Aspiration, Knowledge, Succession and Harmony) by Shri Atul Sobti, Director General, SCOPE, outlining a structured framework for leadership development, succession planning, and HR reforms in CPSEs. Secretary, MNRE, Shri Santosh Kumar Sarangi, Dr R Balasubramaniam, Member (HR), CBC, CEO Karmayogi Bharat (KB) Ms Chhavi Bhardwaj, senior officials from DPE, Ministries and CBC were also present during the inaugural session. The conclave featured focused roundtable discussions on “Reimagining HR Systems for High-Impact CPSE Performance” and “Translating Vision into Action: CPSE HR Strategy”. These discussions enabled peer learning among CPSEs on leadership development, learning and development systems, succession planning, and alignment of HR policies with governance and performance outcomes. Participants emphasised the need for institutionalised collaboration, shared knowledge platforms, and integrated capacity-building efforts to enhance efficiency, innovation, and public value creation beyond financial returns. The discussions reinforced the importance of aligning CPSE human capital strategies with national development priorities and governance reforms under Mission Karmayogi. The conclave is expected to culminate in the development of a “CPSE Capacity Building Compendium”, which will capture best practices, capability gaps, and collaborative models for inter-CPSE capacity development over the next 6–12 months. The CBC will also bring the Training Institutes, PSUs and States on a common platform for collaboration aligned with Karmayogi capacity building efforts across governance space. As a follow up of this conclave, CBC is planning the following Thematic Events for Capacity Building of CPSEs: Financial Management: Long-term capital planning, risk frameworks, governance excellence (including FSIB Sector). R&D, Technology & Innovation Ecosystems: Tech adoption pathways, innovation partnerships, digital transformation (with Academia, ANRF, Research Councils). CSR, ESG & Sustainability Leadership: Responsible business, ESG metrics, climate-aligned strategies Engineering, Projects & Asset Management Excellence: Best-in-class Project Management models, Mega-project execution, Operational Resilience. Learning, Development & Training Ecosystem: Strengthening Capabilities, Cross-PSE knowledge exchange, Research-driven training models. The programme concluded with closing reflections by Shri S. P. Roy, Secretary, Capacity Building Commission who said that CBC is always committed to support capacity building initiatives of CPSEs.  The vote of thanks was delivered by Ms Navneet Kaur, Director, Capacity Building Commission. The Bharat CPSE Consultative Conclave marks a significant step towards strengthening leadership, governance, and institutional capacity of CPSEs in alignment with India’s long-term development vision. ****** NKR/AK (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2206088) आगंतुक पटल  : 94 इस विज्ञप्ति को इन भाषाओं में पढ़ें: Urdu , हिन्दी Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions CBC organises “Bharat CPSEs’ Consultative Conclave” on “Shaping India’s Growth Story through DAKSH PSEs @2047” Chairperson CBC emphasizes upon de-siloization of governance and democratization of learning Dr Alka Mittal, Member, CBC underscores strategic role of CPSEs as critical institutions for nation-building We should be open to change and adapt good changes, says Secretary, DPE, Shri K Moses Chalai प्रविष्टि तिथि:\r\n                        18 DEC 2025 5:51PM by PIB Delhi The Capacity Building Commission (CBC), in collaboration with the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE), Ministry of Finance, organised the Bharat CPSEs’ Consultative Conclave, today at New Delhi.

The Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances monitors the progress through inputs provided by States/UTs on the NeSDA Way Forward Dashboard. Between April 2023 and October 2025, the number of e-services offered by States/UTs increased from 11,614 to 23,919, which is over 105 % growth. During the same period, the saturation of identified mandatory e-services rose from 66% to 80%. 10 States/UTs now deliver over 90 % of their services through a unified portal, and 6 State/UTs provides 100 % of their services through their unified portal. The Department is collaborating with the State Right to Service (RTS) Commissions, on expansion of NeSDA mandatory services for saturation, defining roadmaps for provisioning services through unified portals, and coordinating with the State Governments for enhancing effectiveness of service delivery mechanisms for ensuring timely redressal of public grievances.

The Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances monitors the progress through inputs provided by States/UTs on the NeSDA Way Forward Dashboard. Between April 2023 and October 2025, the number of e-services offered by States/UTs increased from 11,614 to 23,919, which is over 105 % growth. During the same period, the saturation of identified mandatory e-services rose from 66% to 80%. 10 States/UTs now deliver over 90 % of their services through a unified portal, and 6 State/UTs provides 100 % of their services through their unified portal. The Department is collaborating with the State Right to Service (RTS) Commissions, on expansion of NeSDA mandatory services for saturation, defining roadmaps for provisioning services through unified portals, and coordinating with the State Governments for enhancing effectiveness of service delivery mechanisms for ensuring timely redressal of public grievances. The best practices of the Right to Services Commissions are disseminated through NeSDA Way Forward for facilitating adoption by other States to improve eservices delivery.

The details of country's current composition of installed generation capacity, indicating the share of renewable and non-fossil fuel sources are given below . The Government of India has taken several steps and initiatives to promote and accelerate renewable energy capacity in the country to realize the commitment of 500 GW non-fossil energy capacity by 2030. These include, inter-alia, the following: Inter State Transmission System (ISTS) charges have been waived for inter-state sale of solar and wind power for projects to be commissioned by 30th June 2025, for Green Hydrogen Projects till December 2030 and for offshore wind projects till December 2032. Standard Bidding Guidelines for tariff based competitive bidding process for procurement of Power from Grid Connected Solar, Wind, Wind-Solar Hybrid and Firm & Dispatchable RE (FDRE) projects have been issued. Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) has issued Bidding Trajectory for issuance of RE power procurement bids of 50 GW/annum by Renewable Energy Implementing Agencies (REIAs) from FY 2023-24 to FY 2027-28. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has been permitted up to 100 percent under the automatic route. Laying of new transmission lines and creating new sub-station capacity has been funded under the Green Energy Corridor Scheme for evacuation of renewable power To augment transmission infrastructure needed for steep RE trajectory, transmission plan has been prepared till 2032. Scheme for setting up of Solar Parks and Ultra Mega Solar Power projects is being implemented to provide land and transmission to RE developers for installation of RE projects at large scale Schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM), PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, National Programme on High Efficiency Solar PV Modules, New Solar Power Scheme (for Tribal and PVTG Habitations/Villages) under Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM JANMAN) and Dharti Aabha Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (DA JGUA), National Green Hydrogen Mission, Viability Gap Funding (VGF) Scheme for Offshore Wind Energy Projects have been launched To boost RE consumption, Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) followed by Renewable Consumption Obligation (RCO) trajectory has been notified till 2029-30. The RCO which is applicable to all designated consumers under the Energy Conservation Act 2001 will attract penalties on non-compliance. RCO also includes specified quantum of consumption from Decentralized Renewable Energy sources. “Strategy for Establishments of Offshore Wind Energy Projects” has been issued. To achieve the objective of increased domestic production of Solar PV Modules, the Govt. of India is implementing the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for High Efficiency Solar PV Modules. India has achieved a landmark in its energy transition journey by reaching 50% of its installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources in June, 2025 – more than five years ahead of the target set under its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreement. This significant milestone underscores the country’s steadfast commitment to climate action and sustainable development. The impact of this achievement on India’s long term energy transition roadmap is crucial towards the goal of combating climate change, keeping in view energy security, affordability and accessibility as critical inalienable priorities to ensure growth and development alongside Energy transition of the economy towards net-zero by 2070. The major steps taken by India to diversify its Energy Portfolio through clean and safe sources are detailed below: Nuclear power has huge potential to ensure long term energy security and is vital for India’s clean energy transition towards Net Zero by 2070. It is a clean and environment friendly source of base load power. The lifecycle emissions of nuclear power are comparable to those of renewables like hydro and wind.  The Government of India has set an ambitious target of 100 GW nuclear power capacity by 2047. Following steps have been taken   to diversify India’s energy portfolio through Nuclear Energy: A dedicated Nuclear Energy Mission with an allocation of ₹20,000 crore has been launched to develop at least five indigenously designed Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) by 2033 and promote advanced nuclear technologies. Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill, 2025 has been introduced in Parliament to pave a way to harness the full potential of India’s nuclear energy based on indigenous resources to the maximum extent through active involvement of both the public and private sectors. Bharat Small Reactors (BSRs) of 220 MW capacity based on India’s proven Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) technology are being upgraded for deployment in industrial hubs to support decarbonisation. BARC is also developing Small Modular Reactors for repurposing retiring coal stations and for remote-area applications. India’s fuel security is being enhanced through new uranium discoveries, including a significant discovery that would extend the life of the Jaduguda mine by over 50 years. Progress in the closed fuel cycle, such as milestones achieved in the Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor, will further support sustainable fuel supply. To accelerate capacity addition, NPCIL and NTPC have formed the joint venture ASHVINI for developing nuclear power plants within the existing legal framework. Government of India, in September 2023, approved a Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme for development of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS). BESS capacity of 13.22 GWh is under implementation with a budgetary allocation of Rs. 3,760 Cr. under this scheme. Considering the increasing demand of BESS, Ministry of Power, in June 2025, has approved another VGF scheme for development of 30 GWh BESS capacity with a financial support of Rs 5,400 Cr from Power System Development Fund (PSDF). Ministry of Power has introduced a policy to promote Pumped Storage Projects (PSPs) to support renewable energy integration and grid stability. At present, 10 Pumped Storage Projects totaling 11,870 MW are under construction in the country. Strategy for Establishments of Offshore Wind Energy Projects has been issued. Viability gap funding will be provided for harnessing offshore wind energy potential for initial capacity of one giga-watt. Green Hydrogen Mission would contribute significantly to India’s efforts for decarbonization and also create opportunities for employment and economic development. The Mission targets setting up at least 5 MMT per annum of green hydrogen capacity by 2030.

Scheme for setting up of Solar Parks and Ultra Mega Solar Power projects is being implemented to provide land and transmission to RE developers for installation of RE projects at large scale Schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM), PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, National Programme on High Efficiency Solar PV Modules, New Solar Power Scheme (for Tribal and PVTG Habitations/Villages) under Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM JANMAN) and Dharti Aabha Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (DA JGUA), National Green Hydrogen Mission, Viability Gap Funding (VGF) Scheme for Offshore Wind Energy Projects have been launched To boost RE consumption, Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) followed by Renewable Consumption Obligation (RCO) trajectory has been notified till 2029-30. The RCO which is applicable to all designated consumers under the Energy Conservation Act 2001 will attract penalties on non-compliance. RCO also includes specified quantum of consumption from Decentralized Renewable Energy sources. “Strategy for Establishments of Offshore Wind Energy Projects” has been issued. To achieve the objective of increased domestic production of Solar PV Modules, the Govt. of India is implementing the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for High Efficiency Solar PV Modules. India has achieved a landmark in its energy transition journey by reaching 50% of its installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources in June, 2025 – more than five years ahead of the target set under its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreement. This significant milestone underscores the country’s steadfast commitment to climate action and sustainable development. The impact of this achievement on India’s long term energy transition roadmap is crucial towards the goal of combating climate change, keeping in view energy security, affordability and accessibility as critical inalienable priorities to ensure growth and development alongside Energy transition of the economy towards net-zero by 2070. The major steps taken by India to diversify its Energy Portfolio through clean and safe sources are detailed below: Nuclear power has huge potential to ensure long term energy security and is vital for India’s clean energy transition towards Net Zero by 2070. It is a clean and environment friendly source of base load power. The lifecycle emissions of nuclear power are comparable to those of renewables like hydro and wind.  The Government of India has set an ambitious target of 100 GW nuclear power capacity by 2047. Following steps have been taken   to diversify India’s energy portfolio through Nuclear Energy: A dedicated Nuclear Energy Mission with an allocation of ₹20,000 crore has been launched to develop at least five indigenously designed Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) by 2033 and promote advanced nuclear technologies. Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill, 2025 has been introduced in Parliament to pave a way to harness the full potential of India’s nuclear energy based on indigenous resources to the maximum extent through active involvement of both the public and private sectors. Bharat Small Reactors (BSRs) of 220 MW capacity based on India’s proven Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) technology are being upgraded for deployment in industrial hubs to support decarbonisation. BARC is also developing Small Modular Reactors for repurposing retiring coal stations and for remote-area applications. India’s fuel security is being enhanced through new uranium discoveries, including a significant discovery that would extend the life of the Jaduguda mine by over 50 years. Progress in the closed fuel cycle, such as milestones achieved in the Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor, will further support sustainable fuel supply. To accelerate capacity addition, NPCIL and NTPC have formed the joint venture ASHVINI for developing nuclear power plants within the existing legal framework. Government of India, in September 2023, approved a Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme for development of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS). BESS capacity of 13.22 GWh is under implementation with a budgetary allocation of Rs. 3,760 Cr. under this scheme. Considering the increasing demand of BESS, Ministry of Power, in June 2025, has approved another VGF scheme for development of 30 GWh BESS capacity with a financial support of Rs 5,400 Cr from Power System Development Fund (PSDF). Ministry of Power has introduced a policy to promote Pumped Storage Projects (PSPs) to support renewable energy integration and grid stability. At present, 10 Pumped Storage Projects totaling 11,870 MW are under construction in the country. Strategy for Establishments of Offshore Wind Energy Projects has been issued. Viability gap funding will be provided for harnessing offshore wind energy potential for initial capacity of one giga-watt. Green Hydrogen Mission would contribute significantly to India’s efforts for decarbonization and also create opportunities for employment and economic development. The Mission targets setting up at least 5 MMT per annum of green hydrogen capacity by 2030.

The Government is drawing upon global best practices from countries with high renewable-energy penetration as part of India’s energy-transition strategy.  International experience demonstrates that Pumped-hydro storage and BESS, and advanced grid-management systems play a critical role in managing variability and intermittency of renewable energy.  In line with these practices, energy storage systems in India are being positioned to provide ancillary grid services such as frequency control, voltage regulation, peak shifting, congestion management and black-start support across different time scales. Accordingly, under the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (Ancillary Services) Regulations, 2022, energy storage systems have been made eligible to provide Secondary Reserve Ancillary Services and Tertiary Reserve Ancillary Services, subject to specified conditions, thereby supporting real-time grid stability and reliable system operation. Renewable Energy Management Centres (REMCs) have been established for monitoring, forecasting and scheduling of Renewable resources.  ⁠ Automatic Generation Control (AGC)is being used for balancing supply and demand to manage variability of renewable energy. Government has put in place a planning framework to guide large-scale deployment of energy storage capacity in the coming years.  The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has estimated a requirement of about 336 GWh of energy storage capacity by 2029-30 and about 411 GWh by 2031-32 to facilitate reliable integration of renewable energy.  Further, Guidelines for Preparation of Resource Adequacy Plans (RAP) were issued on 28.06.2023, which incorporate energy storage systems as an important element of power sector planning.  These guidelines establish a mechanism to ensure that adequate generation, storage and demand-responsive resources are available to reliably meet expected peak demand and maintain grid stability.  Together, the National Electricity Plan and Resource Adequacy framework provide a roadmap for scaling up energy-storage capacity, improving system reliability and enabling India’s energy transition. Policy and Regulatory Measures The Electricity Rules were amended in December 2022 to explicitly recognise Energy Storage Systems (ESS) as an integral part of the power system, enabling their participation across generation, transmission and distribution functions. In October 2022, ESS were included in the Harmonised Master List of Infrastructure of the Ministry of Finance, facilitating access to long-tenure and lower-cost financing. In June 2023, the Government issued Guidelines for Preparation of Resource Adequacy Plans by State utilities, under which energy storage has been incorporated as a key planning resource for meeting peak demand and ensuring system reliability. A National Framework for Promotion of Energy Storage Systems was issued in September 2023, providing a comprehensive roadmap for deployment, market integration and regulatory facilitation of storage technologies. To enhance safety and reliability of BESS installations and standardise design and construction practices, Draft CEA (Measures Relating to Safety and Electric Supply) (First Amendment) Regulations, 2025 and Draft Technical Standards for Construction of BESS Regulations, 2025 have been issued. II. Demand-Side Enablers and Market Development Measures Waiver of Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) charges has been provided for co-located BESS projects commissioned and PSPs awarded up to June 2028, to improve project viability (initial waiver was notified in November 2021). In January 2022, CERC allowed storage-based resources to provide ancillary services, including secondary and tertiary reserves, enabling ESS to support real-time grid balancing alongside conventional generators. Tariff-Based Competitive Bidding (TBCB) Guidelines for procurement of BESS by distribution licensees were notified in March 2022, creating a transparent mechanism for large-scale storage procurement. Under the Electricity (Rights of Consumers) Rules, 2020, amended in December 2022, consumers using diesel generator sets have been mandated to shift to cleaner backup solutions, including energy storage, within timelines specified by State Commissions. Electricity supplied from BESS has been allowed to participate in the High-Price Day-Ahead Market, launched in March 2023, enabling storage to respond to peak price signals similar to gas-based generation. The Government is implementing two Viability Gap Funding (VGF) schemes to support development of approximately 43 GWh of Battery Energy Storage Systems, launched in March 2024 and June 2025, to accelerate early-stage deployment. III. Supply-Side and Manufacturing-Focused Measures The Ministry of Heavy Industries is implementing a Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme with an outlay of ₹18,100 crore for establishing 50 GWh of Advanced Chemistry Cell manufacturing capacity, of which 10 GWh is earmarked for grid-scale storage (June 2021). For pumped storage projects, a grant for enabling infrastructure is provided at the rate of ₹1 crore per MW for the first 200 MW and ₹0.75 crore per MW thereafter (September 2023). CERC has allowed separate grid connectivity during non-solar hours, enabling additional renewable capacity at existing substations and facilitating storage-based shifting of power to evening and night hours (September 2025). Statutory concurrence of the Central Electricity Authority has been dispensed with for closed-loop, off-stream pumped storage projects to expedite project development (August 2025). Through amendment of the Electricity Rules in September 2025, energy storage systems have been permitted to be developed, owned, leased or operated by consumers, expanding the range of ownership and business models. In February 2025, CEA issued an advisory on co-location of ESS with solar power projects, recommending storage capacity of at least 10% of installed solar capacity for a minimum duration of two hours, to improve dispatchability of solar power. This Information was given by the Minister of State for Power, Shri Shripad Yesso Naik, in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today. ********* NR/MD (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205959) आगंतुक पटल  : 133 Ministry of Power Development and Deployment of Energy Storage Capacities to Power Reliable Renewable Future प्रविष्टि तिथि:\r\n                        18 DEC 2025 4:36PM by PIB Delhi To address the intermittency of renewable energy and to maintain grid stability, the Government of India has taken a series of coordinated policy, regulatory, demand-side and supply-side measures to promote the development and deployment of energy-storage technologies, including Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and Pumped Storage Projects (PSPs).  Details of the measures taken are detailed below.

The Minister said that the country has moved with confidence from being a major importer of defence equipment to a nation that designs, develops, manufactures and increasingly exports advanced defence systems, firmly positioning defence self-reliance as a cornerstone of India’s rise as a strong, secure and self-assured global power. He added that the defence sector has undergone a structural transformation from import dependence to indigenous capability, anchored in the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat and Make in India – Make for the World. In recognition of the momentum achieved, 2025 has been declared the ‘Year of Reforms’ in the Ministry of Defence, marking accelerated progress in defence indigenisation alongside enhanced operational preparedness of the Armed Forces. Shri Naik noted that defence production reached an all-time high of ₹1.54 lakh crore in FY 2024–25, rising from ₹46,429 crore in 2014–15, demonstrating the scale, depth and maturity of India’s indigenous defence manufacturing base. Defence exports surged to a record ₹23,622 crore in FY 2024–25, compared to less than ₹1,000 crore in 2014, underscoring India’s emergence as a credible and competitive global defence supplier. India has supplied a wide spectrum of defence products—including ammunition, arms, sub-systems, complete systems and critical components—to around 80 countries, reaffirming its role as a reliable partner in the global defence supply chain. He further said that the private sector’s contribution has risen to nearly 23% of total defence production, reflecting growing competitiveness, innovation and confidence of Indian industry, while Defence Public Sector Undertakings continue to play a critical role, accounting for about 77% of total defence production within a more accountable and performance-oriented framework. Five Positive Indigenisation Lists, covering over 5,500 items, have been notified, with more than 3,000 items already indigenised, decisively reducing import dependence and strengthening domestic capability. The Minister observed that indigenous platforms such as LCA Tejas, LCH Prachand, ATAGS, Akash missile systems, radars, corvettes, armoured vehicles and drones are significantly enhancing the operational readiness and combat capability of the Armed Forces. Operation Sindoor, executed on the strength of indigenous equipment and systems, marked a milestone in India’s journey towards technological self-reliance in drone warfare, layered air defence and electronic warfare, clearly demonstrating the operational relevance of Atmanirbharta. Shri Naik said that Mission Sudarshan Chakra, announced by Prime Minister Modi from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Independence Day 2025, aims at neutralising enemy defence infiltrations and strengthening India’s offensive and protective capabilities. Inspired by the legendary Sudarshan Chakra of Shri Krishna, the mission symbolises speed, precision and decisive power, underscoring India’s commitment to strategic autonomy and rapid, effective response. Under this mission, an expanded nationwide security shield is envisaged, with enhanced protection of public spaces and critical areas by 2035, reflecting a long-term, self-reliant approach to national security. He informed that defence Industrial Corridors in Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have together attracted investments of over ₹9,145 crore, with 289 MoUs signed, unlocking ₹66,423 crore in potential opportunities. The Defence Procurement Manual 2025, launched in October 2025, simplifies revenue procurement of goods and services worth nearly ₹1 lakh crore, enhancing transparency, uniformity and participation of domestic industry. A comprehensive review of the Defence Acquisition Procedure 2020 has also been initiated to align procurement with national priorities, promote indigenous design and facilitate technology infusion. Talking about allocation in the Union Budget 2025–26, he informed that ₹6.81 lakh crore has been allotted to the Ministry of Defence. This includes ₹1.80 lakh crore allocated for capital outlay, with 75% of the modernisation budget earmarked for domestic procurement, providing strong and sustained demand for Indian manufacturers. Innovations for Defence Excellence has emerged as a key enabler of defence innovation by integrating start-ups, MSMEs and academia into the defence ecosystem, while DRDO continues to drive innovation, supported by a ₹500 crore corpus under the Technology Development Fund and 15 Defence Industry–Academia Centres of Excellence. The restructuring of the Ordnance Factory Board into seven DPSUs has further enhanced autonomy, efficiency and export orientation of legacy defence manufacturing. With over 16,000 MSMEs now part of the defence ecosystem, Atmanirbharta has become a broad-based national endeavour. The Government has set a clear vision of achieving ₹3 lakh crore defence production and ₹50,000 crore defence exports by 2029, positioning India as a global defence manufacturing hub. While concluding, the Minister said that Atmanirbharta in defence today is not an aspiration; it is a measurable and credible reality, reflected in rising production, expanding exports and proven operational capability. As India advances towards becoming a global defence manufacturing hub, this journey will continue to strengthen the Armed Forces, empower Indian industry and reinforce India’s position as a confident, capable and reliable partner in the global security architecture. *** NR/AP (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205873) आगंतुक पटल  : 264 इस विज्ञप्ति को इन भाषाओं में पढ़ें: Urdu , हिन्दी , Gujarati Ministry of Power India’s Atmanirbharta in Defence Emerges as a Measurable and Credible Reality: Shripad Naik Structural reforms, record defence production and exports mark India’s transformation from importer to global defence manufacturer प्रविष्टि तिथि:\r\n                        18 DEC 2025 3:44PM by PIB Delhi Union Minister of State for Power and New & Renewable Energy, Shri Shripad Yesso Naik, while addressing a press conference in New delhi today said that India’s journey towards Atmanirbharta in defence has been decisively shaped by the visionary and resolute leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, whose clear articulation that national security, economic strength and technological sovereignty are deeply interconnected has transformed defence manufacturing from a strategic necessity into a national mission.

Identification of key players in the early steps of autophagosome biogenesis, a key stage in the autophagy pathway, can lay the foundations for modulating the pathway for finding interventions that can restore the pathway in diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson's, and cancer. Just as our homes need regular cleaning, our cells also clear out damaged and unwanted materials through a process called autophagy. When a cell fails to clear waste, its health suffers, especially in long-lived neurons. The autophagy pathway, which removes damaged material and defends against infections, is disrupted in diseases like Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s. Autophagy also has dual roles in cancer: preventing it early on but supporting tumor growth later. Autophagy acts as tumor suppressor by maintaining genome integrity and cellular homeostasis by clearing cellular junk such as protein aggregates and damaged mitochondria. But it is also a double-edged sword as certain types of cancer cells hijack autophagy for their own survival and propagation. Understanding its regulation is crucial for the development of effective therapies. Researchers from Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), an autonomous institution under the Department of Science and Technology (DST) found that a group of proteins called the exocyst complex, which normally helps move important molecules to the cell surface, also plays a key role in autophagy. This complex comprises a team of 8 proteins; interestingly, 7 of the 8 proteins are required to help the cell grow the trash bag so that it can completely wrap up the waste. When this complex is missing, the cell’s bag-making factory stops working properly and even starts producing faulty, non-functional factories. Fig : An autophagosome engulfing its cargo. In this microscopic image, an autophagosome, shown in green, attempts to wrap around a protein aggregate, shown in magenta. The size is around 1-2 microns. The researchers led by Prof. Ravi Manjithaya used simple yeast cells to elucidate the formation of autophagosomes (cellular “trash bags”), thereby providing insights into how this vital process operates in higher organisms. They elucidated the mechanism by which a protein complex exocyst, previously recognized for its role in secretion, also contributes to the autophagy pathway, which is crucial for maintaining cellular health. Since defects in autophagy are linked to several neurodegenerative diseases and cancers, the findings published in,” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences”, have opened new avenues for modulating this pathway to restore cellular balance and develop potential therapeutic.

    "content": "Press Release:Press Information Bureau Ministry of Science & Technology PARLIAMENT QUESTION: PROMOTION OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INDIGENOUS MANUFACTURING IN BIOPHARMA SECTOR प्रविष्टि तिथि:\r\n                18 DEC 2025 4:14PM by PIB Delhi The Government of India has taken steps for promoting entrepreneurship and indigenous manufacturing in the biopharma sector. Department of Biotechnology (DBT) has set up Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC), a not-for-profit Section 8 Public Sector Enterprise, in 2012, as an interface agency to nurture and strengthen the startup ecosystem and encourage entrepreneurship with a focus on healthcare sector that covers Pharma and Biopharma. BIRAC through funding grants has supported startups, SMEs, and innovators. Some of the key achievements of BIRAC include: Funding and supporting early-stage innovation Launched flagship funding schemes such as BIG (Biotechnology Ignition Grant), SPARSH (Social Innovation Programme for Products: Affordable & Relevant to Societal Health), Equity Schemes like SEED Fund (Sustainable Entrepreneurship and Enterprise Development) and LEAP Fund (Launching Entrepreneurial Driven Affordable Products), to strengthen the startup ecosystem and incentivize private sector R&D by addressing funding gaps post-ideation and pre-commercialization. Nearly 1000 Startups and entrepreneurs have benefitted from BIG scheme and SPARSH has awarded 150+ fellowships, creating 100+ startups and 65+ IPs. Strengthening India’s biotech innovation ecosystem BIRAC has established a strong network of incubators, including 94 Incubation and pre-incubation centres, supporting 3000+ incubates and fellows, across 25 states and UTs of the country. Opportunities have been provided through BioNEST (Bioincubators Nurturing Entrepreneurship for Scaling Technologies) and E-YUVA (Empowering Youth for Undertaking Value-Added Innovation Translational Research) schemes. The Department of Biotechnology (DBT) is supporting the National Biopharma Mission (NBM), a Cabinet approved Program entitled Industry-Academia Collaborative Mission for Accelerating Discovery Research to Early Development for Biopharmaceuticals – “Innovate in India ( i3 ) Empowering biotech entrepreneurs & accelerating inclusive innovation”; being implemented through Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC). This Program is enhancing India’s innovation research and product development capabilities, especially by focusing on development of vaccines, biologics and medical devices for combating public health concerns. Some key achievements of NBM include: Under NBM, support has been provided to over 100 biopharma-oriented projects, involving many MSMEs/startups, and facilitating creation of shared facilities (testing, validation, manufacturing) — driving domestic capacity for biologics, vaccines, diagnostics. Product Development - The Mission has successfully delivered 02 COVID-19 vaccines, ZyCoV D and Corbevax, biosimilar Liraglutide for diabetes, pegylated interferon alpha-2b for COVID-19, first indigenous MRI scanner, single-use bioreactors, 09 Covid-19 diagnostic kits, ventilators and reagents, Laboratory Information Management System, CHO Cell culture media, which have been developed and commercialized. Ecosystem strengthening - NBM has supported setting-up research and GMP manufacturing facilities where over 500 services have been rendered via 18 functional facilities. For the first time in India a network of 7 Technology Transfers Offices (TTOs) has been set up to facilitate patent filings and technology transfers. A network of 46 GCP-compliant clinical trial sites has been set up to facilitate trials for vaccines and therapeutics. DBT with the approval of the Cabinet, has subsumed its 13 Autonomous Institutions (AIs) and created one Autonomous Body, the Biotechnology Research and Innovation Council (BRIC), as a registered Society. BRIC is intended to integrate the multi-disciplinary research, training, and innovation programs operational across various DBT institutions. BRIC By-Laws have enabling provision for supporting scientific entrepreneurship and research commercialization. The operational guidelines and approval mechanisms for availing the provisions of the scheme while in employment at iBRIC have been simplified and notified. DBT with the approval of the Cabinet, in 2024, is implementing the BioE3 policy towards fostering High-performance Biomanufacturing in the country impacting the economy, environment and employment. Under this initiative, Biofoundries and Biomanufacturing hubs are being established across the country in all the identified thematic verticals of the Biomanufacturing program including \"Precision biotherapeutics\" for promoting domestic manufacturing of monoclonal antibodies, mRNA therapies, cell and gene therapies and other such advanced precision medicines. The programs are under support. Also, the Department under its “National Biotechnology Park Scheme” supported a project to establish a Biopharma Growth Phase park (B-Hub) at Genome Valley, Hyderabad with the aim to provide a platform for biopharma start-ups and companies to conduct proof-of-concept study at its scale-up manufacturing facility. Currently, the Park is under construction.

Addressing the gathering, Union Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy warmly welcomed the Ambassadors and thanked them for their presence, noting that their participation reflected the importance India places on trusted international partnerships. He underlined that India’s steel sector today mirrors the country’s broader economic transformation and has emerged as a pillar of growth, resilience and global integration. The Minister highlighted that India is currently the world’s second-largest steel producer, a position achieved through sustained reforms, steady investments and a clear long-term vision focused on modernization, self-reliance and sustainability. He noted that the steel sector contributes around 2.5 percent to India’s GDP and supports nearly 2.8 million livelihoods, with demand being driven by infrastructure expansion, manufacturing growth and strategic sectors such as defence and mobility. Referring to the National Steel Policy 2017 and the visionary leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, Union Minister H.D.Kumaraswamy said India is progressing steadily towards a steel capacity of 300 million tonnes by 2030, with an even more ambitious target of 500 million tonnes by 2047. These milestones, he said, would further integrate India with global steel value chains and open new avenues for international collaboration. Against this backdrop, the Union Minister announced that the Ministry of Steel has decided to institutionalize an annual flagship International Conference-cum-Exhibition titled “Bharat Steel.” He informed the gathering that the first edition, Bharat Steel 2026, will be in April 2026 at Bharat Mandapam, New Delhi. H.D.Kumaraswamy explained that Bharat Steel 2026 is envisioned as a global platform bringing together policymakers, industry leaders, investors, technology providers and buyers from across the world. A key feature of the event will be a dedicated Reverse Buyer–Seller Meet aimed at facilitating structured B2B engagements and fostering long-term partnerships. He said the conference would focus on expanding steel consumption, promoting sustainability and the circular economy, securing raw material supply chains, accelerating technological innovation and enabling investments for capacity expansion. The event will also deliberate on future-defining themes such as green steel ecosystems, digitally enabled steel plants and mines, efficient utilisation of low-grade ores through beneficiation and pelletisation, advanced steels for clean energy and mobility, and the transition towards a circular steel economy. The Union Minister encouraged Ambassadors and country representatives to facilitate participation from their respective countries, particularly from industry leaders, technology providers and investors. He also invited partner nations to take part in Country Roundtables and associate as Partner Countries at Bharat Steel 2026, stating that such engagement would further strengthen bilateral cooperation and long-term collaboration in the steel sector. The interactive session concluded with H.D. Kumaraswamy expressing confidence that, with strong international participation and support, Bharat Steel 2026 would emerge as a landmark global event for the steel industry. He said the Ministry looks forward to welcoming international delegations to New Delhi in April 2026 for what is envisioned to be a defining platform for shaping the future of global steel cooperation. **** AG (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2206267) आगंतुक पटल  : 82 Ministry of Steel Bharat Steel 2026: HD Kumaraswamy Engages Ambassadors to Build Global Steel Partnerships India Invites the World to Bharat Steel 2026: Union Minister HD Kumaraswamy Strengthening Global Steel Ties: Ambassadors Meet Union Steel Minister Ahead of Bharat Steel 2026 India’s Steel Vision Takes Global Shape at Ambassadorial Meet Led by HD Kumaraswamy प्रविष्टि तिथि:\r\n                        18 DEC 2025 8:45PM by PIB Delhi Union Minister for Steel and Heavy Industries Shri H.D.

The details of the projects of Tourism Circuits sanctioned under Swadesh Darshan scheme in the country including North Eastern States is annexed as Annexure-I. Swadesh Darshan scheme has now been revamped as Swadesh Darshan 2.0 (SD2.0) with the idea to develop sustainable and responsible tourism destinations. The Ministry also provides financial assistance to the State Governments/ UT Administrations under its ‘Challenge Based Destination Development (CBDD)’, a sub-scheme of Swadesh Darshan 2.0 for development of tourism infrastructure and experiences. The details of the projects sanctioned under SD2.0 and CBDD schemes in the country including North Eastern States is annexed as Annexure - II . Also, Ministry under ‘Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual Heritage Augmentation Drive (PRASHAD)’ provides financial assistance to the State Governments/UT Administrations for development of tourism infrastructure and experiences. The details of the projects sanctioned under PRASHAD scheme in the country including North Eastern States is annexed as Annexure - III . Government of India under its ‘Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment (SASCI) – Development of Iconic Tourist Centres to Global Scale’ also sanctioned 40 projects in the country, with the primary objective to comprehensively develop iconic tourist centres in the country, branding and marketing them at global scale. As per the SASCI scheme guidelines, the projects are implemented and managed by the concerned State Government and projects are to be developed and completed within maximum 2 year’s period, whereas Government of India will release funds under this scheme up to 31 st March, 2026. The details of the projects sanctioned under SASCI scheme in the country including North Eastern States is annexed as Annexure - IV . With the aim to promote tourism in tribal areas, the Ministry of Tourism has recently issued guidelines along with template for formulation of proposal by State Governments and UT Administrations for 'Development of Homestays in Tribal Areas' (A sub-scheme of Swadesh Darshan Scheme) under Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PMJUGA). The objective of the initiative is to develop homestays in tribal areas to promote responsible tourism and enhance livelihood opportunities for tribal communities. However, Ministry of Tourism does not maintain details of measurable socio-economic outcomes that the rural tourism enterprises, like homestays, nature-trail clusters and community-based tourism programmes, have produced, particularly in terms of increase in family income and employment generation. This information was given by Union Minister for Tourism and Culture Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today. **** Sunil Kumar Tiwari tourism4pib[at]gmail[dot]com ANNEXURE-I The list of the projects sanctioned under Swadesh Darshan scheme S.

However, the Ministry of Tourism through its various schemes provides financial assistance to the State Governments (SGs)/UT Administrations (UTAs) to complement these efforts by sanctioning projects, on receipt of the detailed project proposals (DPRs) from them in line with the scheme guidelines, Government instructions, inter-se-priority and availability of budget etc. The Ministry of Tourism in 2014-15 launched its Swadesh Darshan (SD) scheme with the idea to develop tourism infrastructure under identified thematic circuits such as Spiritual, Buddhist, Krishna, Ramayana, Tirthankar etc. in the country. This scheme has now been revamped as Swadesh Darshan 2.0 (SD2.0) with the objective to develop sustainable and responsible tourism destinations. The Ministry also provides financial assistance to the State Governments/ UT Administrations under its ‘Challenge Based Destination Development (CBDD)’, a sub-scheme of Swadesh Darshan. Further, the Ministry in 2014-15 also launched ‘Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual Heritage Augmentation Drive (PRASHAD)’ with the objective of integrated development at identified pilgrimage & heritage destinations. In addition, Government of India under its ‘Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment (SASCI) – Development of Iconic Tourist Centres to Global Scale’ also sanctioned 40 projects in the country, with the primary objective to comprehensively develop iconic tourist centres in the country, branding and marketing them at global scale. For projects sanctioned at pilgrimage and spiritual destinations under the aforesaid schemes, Ministry of Tourism provides financial assistance to State Governments and Union Territory Administrations for development of required facilities for construction and upgradation of approach roads and parking facilities; development of essential amenities such as landscaping, pathways, CCTV, illumination and gazebos; and creation of tourist facilitation infrastructure, including multi-cuisine food courts with souvenir shops, waiting lounges, etc. The details of the projects sanctioned under aforesaid schemes including those at pilgrimage and spiritual destinations is annexed . Ministry of Tourism does not maintain specific data in respect of number of pilgrims visits. However, Ministry of Tourism collects and compiles data on Domestic Tourist Visits (DTVs) from States/UTs, which also include visits undertaken for pilgrimage purposes. The details of Domestic Tourist Visits (DTVs) during 2019 to 2024 are given below: Year DTVs (in Million) 2019 2321.98 2020 610.22 2021 677.63 2022 1731.01 2023 2508.82 2024 2948.19 Source : State/UT Tourism Departments This information was given by Union Minister for Tourism and Culture Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today. ***** Sunil Kumar Tiwari tourism4pib[at]gmail[dot]com ANNEXURE The list of the projects sanctioned under Swadesh Darshan scheme S.N.

However, the Ministry of Tourism through its various schemes provides financial assistance to the State Governments (SGs)/UT Administrations (UTAs) to complement these efforts by sanctioning projects, on receipt of the detailed project proposals (DPRs) from them in line with the scheme guidelines, Government instructions, inter-se-priority and availability of budget etc. The Ministry of Tourism in 2014-15 launched its Swadesh Darshan (SD) scheme with the idea to develop tourism infrastructure under identified thematic circuits such as Spiritual, Buddhist, Krishna, Ramayana, Tirthankar etc. in the country. This scheme has now been revamped as Swadesh Darshan 2.0 (SD2.0) with the objective to develop sustainable and responsible tourism destinations. The Ministry also provides financial assistance to the State Governments/ UT Administrations under its ‘Challenge Based Destination Development (CBDD)’, a sub-scheme of Swadesh Darshan. Further, the Ministry in 2014-15 also launched ‘Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual Heritage Augmentation Drive (PRASHAD)’ with the objective of integrated development at identified pilgrimage & heritage destinations. In addition, Government of India under its ‘Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment (SASCI) – Development of Iconic Tourist Centres to Global Scale’ also sanctioned 40 projects in the country, with the primary objective to comprehensively develop iconic tourist centres in the country, branding and marketing them at global scale. For projects sanctioned at pilgrimage and spiritual destinations under the aforesaid schemes, Ministry of Tourism provides financial assistance to State Governments and Union Territory Administrations for development of required facilities for construction and upgradation of approach roads and parking facilities; development of essential amenities such as landscaping, pathways, CCTV, illumination and gazebos; and creation of tourist facilitation infrastructure, including multi-cuisine food courts with souvenir shops, waiting lounges, etc. The details of the projects sanctioned under aforesaid schemes including those at pilgrimage and spiritual destinations is annexed . Ministry of Tourism does not maintain specific data in respect of number of pilgrims visits. However, Ministry of Tourism collects and compiles data on Domestic Tourist Visits (DTVs) from States/UTs, which also include visits undertaken for pilgrimage purposes. The details of Domestic Tourist Visits (DTVs) during 2019 to 2024 are given below: Year DTVs (in Million) 2019 2321.98 2020 610.22 2021 677.63 2022 1731.01 2023 2508.82 2024 2948.19 Source : State/UT Tourism Departments This information was given by Union Minister for Tourism and Culture Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today. ***** Sunil Kumar Tiwari tourism4pib[at]gmail[dot]com ANNEXURE The list of the projects sanctioned under Swadesh Darshan scheme S.N.

The Ministry, in association with the Indian Missions, undertakes several initiatives such as participation in various global travel trade exhibitions and Marts, organization of familiarization tours for the foreign tour operators, media personnel, social media influencers, organization of India Food Festivals overseas, organization of trade events with the local tour operators and industry stakeholders, promotion of tourist destinations, products and festivals through social media outreach etc. The Ministry endeavours to strengthen domestic tourism through various initiatives including Dekho Apna Desh, Bharat Parv and Best Tourism Village competition etc. Dekho Apna Desh initiative aims to raise awareness of India's rich heritage and culture, foster national pride, and encourage extensive domestic travel. Under this initiative, Ministry of Tourism has organized webinars about different lesser-known destinations, quiz contests and other competitions both online and offline. Several domestic promotional events are also organised in association with tourism stakeholders. Bharat Parv is a flagship annual event organized by the Ministry of Tourism as part of the Republic Day celebrations. The event showcases India’s rich cultural, artistic, culinary, and spiritual diversity and aims to promote the spirit of “Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat.” The event features display of Republic Day tableaux, food festival, participation of handicraft and handloom artisans, pavilions by tourism departments of State Governments / Union Territories, Central Ministries, cultural performances etc. The Best Tourism Villages Competition was undertaken to honour a village that best exemplifies a tourism destination in preserving cultural and natural assets, promoting community-based values and lifestyles and its commitment to sustainability. In the last two editions of the Best Tourism Village Competition, held in 2023 and 2024, a total of 71 villages were recognized as Best Tourism Villages. To Position India as a leading global MICE destination, the Ministry of Tourism has developed a National Strategy and Roadmap for the MICE industry. As part of this initiative, in 2021, “Meet in India” sub-brand was launched, with the vision to promote India as a hub for mega conferences and exhibitions, creating awareness and building a positive global perception of the country’s MICE potential.

    "content": "Press Release:Press Information Bureau PIB Headquarters Crafted in India, Delivered Globally: Exports Powered by Trade Agreements प्रविष्टि तिथि:\r\n                18 DEC 2025 7:17PM by PIB Delhi Key Takeaways Between November 2024 and November 2025, India’s total exports rose from US$ 64.05 billion to US$ 73.99 billion, registering a strong 15.52% growth. India has inked a series of major Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), the most recent being the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with Oman. Active negotiations ongoing with several other countries. Export diversification is further poised to strengthen trade stability, competitiveness, and long-term economic security amid global uncertainties. India’s Trade Story at a Glance Driven by diversification, innovation, and strategic trade reforms, India continues to strengthen its position in global markets. From strong post-pandemic recovery to enduring global uncertainties, India’s exports are not just growing, they are setting new benchmarks. The year-on-year rise from November 2024 to November 2025 highlights India as a trusted and reliable partner in global trade . Between November 2024 and November 2025, India’s total exports rose from US$ 64.05 billion to US$ 73.99 billion , registering a strong 15.52% growth , while imports remained largely stable at US$ 80.63 billion. Consequently, the trade deficit narrowed significantly by 61.07% , from US$ 17.06 billion to US$ 6.64 billion.Despite trade disruption, this growth reflects India’s resilience, with high-value commodities, widening global partnerships, and policy reforms supporting a more balanced and globally integrated trade trajectory. For export growth India is also focused on enhancing its international trade relations. India's trade agreements with other economies reinforces its commitment to inclusive growth, benefiting farmers, artisans, workers, MSMEs while safeguarding core national interests. Most recently, the India–Oman agreement builds on long standing bilateral ties, creating a forward looking and balanced economic framework. Powering Global Trade: India’s Export Journey India’s exports recorded year-on-year growth in November 2025, reflecting sustained momentum in external trade. The increase was supported by higher export values across key merchandise and services sectors, alongside steady demand from major partner countries. This performance underscores the resilience of India’s export sector amid evolving global trade conditions. Merchandise exports during November 2025 were US$ 38.13 Billion as compared to US$ 31.94 Billion in November 2024, registering a growth of 19.38% over the year. Services export for November 2025 is US$ 35.86 Billion as compared to US$ 32.11 Billion in November 2024, indicating growth of 11.67% in a year. The share of merchandise exports was 51.53%, whereas service exports constituted 48.47% share in total exports in November 2025. Readymade garments of all textiles , a labor-intensive sector, continue to contribute positively. Exports rose to USD 1247.37 Million with 11.27% increase in November 2025 compared to last year.Some of the large export markets for India which clocked impressive growth rates were UAE (14.5%), UK (1.5%), Japan (19.0%), Germany (2.9%), Spain (9.0%) and France (9.2%). On the other hand, some of the other markets that recorded higher growth rates were Egypt (27%), Saudi Arabia (12.5%), Hong Kong (69%) etc. This performance highlights the sector’s adaptability and competitiveness in the face of global uncertainties. Similarly, Organic and Inorganic Chemicals exports grew by 18.49% over the year in November 2025. India’s drugs and pharmaceutical sector which is recognised as the Pharmacy of the World,  experienced 20.19% growth in exports over the year. Indian pharma exports are destined to more than 200 countries around the globe including highly regulated markets of US, West Europe, Japan and Australia indicating diversification in this sector too. Export of Gems and Jewellery also registered a growth of 27.8% in November, 2025. Indian jewellery is admired for its craftsmanship, design, and cultural richness. Demand is growing in key markets such as the United States, United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, and Europe, especially for gold, diamond, and coloured gemstone jewellery. India has witnessed a remarkable surge in petroleum product exports over the last decade. India is the seventh-largest exporter of refined petroleum products and ranks among the top five refining nations globally, due to its robust infrastructure and strategic geographic location. The export growth in November 2025 was 11.65% when compared from the corresponding year in the last year. Key export destinations include South Asian, African, and European countries. Engineering goods , a traditional pillar of India’s exports, have recorded steady growth, with the US as the top destination, followed by the UAE, Germany, the UK, and Saudi Arabia. To sustain momentum, the government has rolled out measures such as Zero Duty EPCG and the Market Access Initiative (MAI) to support exporters and boost overseas revenues. With a target of building a $500 billion domestic electronics ecosystem by 2030-31 , India is now firmly on track to become a global leader in electronic design, manufacturing, and exports. Leading the way are mobile phones from just ₹1,500 crore in 2014-15, mobile phone exports reached ₹2 lakh crore in 2024-25, growing 127 times in a single decade. Indian electronics goods are now exported to major markets, with the top five destinations in FY 2024-25 being the United States, United Arab Emirates, Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Italy. Export Diversification: A Strategic Approach Export diversification has emerged as a deliberate policy strategy. It helps navigate uncertain global trade environments marked by geopolitical tensions, demand volatility, and supply chain disruptions. By expanding across products and markets, countries reduce overdependence on limited partners and build resilience against external shocks. This approach strengthens trade stability, competitiveness, and long-term economic security amid global uncertainties. Avoiding export instability and reducing dependency Commodity dependent exports are inherently exposed to sharp price fluctuations, which can lead to instability in export earnings if countries rely on a narrow set of products. Such volatility may heighten macroeconomic uncertainty and dampen long-term investment decisions. Export diversification offers a pathway to greater stability by spreading risk across products and markets, thereby supporting sustained export growth and long-term economic resilience . Building resilience against global demand shocks Building resilience against global demand shocks is crucial, as limited export diversification can leave economies vulnerable to sudden downturns in global demand. Diversifying exports enhances the ability to absorb such economic shocks by spreading risk across sectors and markets, thereby ensuring greater stability in export performance. Encouraging knowledge spillover Export diversification fosters flow of ideas, skills, and information by encouraging the adoption of new production techniques, management practices, and marketing capabilities that can diffuse across industries. By expanding the range of export products, economies strengthen learning, innovation, and productivity, supporting higher per capita income growth over the long term. Strengthening macroeconomic stability Exports alone accounted for 21.2% of India’s GDP in 2024. Limited diversification can expose the economy to global uncertainties and export shortfalls, affecting macroeconomic stability. Export diversification strengthens stability by broadening economic activity, reducing vulnerability to external shocks, and supporting sustainable growth and improved living standards. Expanding Global Ties: Unlocking Trade Opportunities for India As India’s economic footprint continues to expand worldwide, it has emerged as a preferred partner for deeper trade and economic collaboration. India and Oman sign CEPA: India’s 2nd FTA in the last 6 months after UK DID YOU KNOW? Oman is a key pillar of India’s West Asia Policy and India’s oldest strategic partner in the region. The strong economic partnership is reflected in 6,000+ India–Oman joint ventures operating in Oman. India signed a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with Oman on 18 December 2025, marking a significant step in strengthening economic engagement with the Gulf region, as the two countries commemorate 70 years of diplomatic relations. The agreement underscores India’s growing stature as a trusted and dependable global trade partner. The agreement opens new export opportunities for India’s labour-intensive sectors- such as agriculture, textiles, leather, gems and jewellery, engineering, pharmaceuticals, and automobiles- supporting job creation and empowering artisans, women-led enterprises, and MSMEs. India held a 10.24% share in Oman’s agricultural imports in 2024, ranking second among suppliers. Major export items include Basmati rice, parboiled rice, bananas, potatoes, onions, meal of soyabean, sweet biscuits, cashew kernels, mixed condiments, butter, fish body oil, prawn & shrimps feed, frozen boneless bovine meat, and fertilized eggs. Duty free access to boneless meat of bovine animals, other fresh eggs, sweet biscuits, cashew kernels, other fats & oils derived from milk, other mixed condiments & seasonings, prepared/preserved potatoes, other egg yolks not dried, guar gum, kabuli chana and other cheese provide a competitive edge over other countries exporting to Oman. Elimination of the tariff from butter, sugar confectionery, bakery products, poultry meat & offal, mixed condiments & mixed seasoning, other fruit squash prepared/preserved, natural honey strengthens India’s position in Oman’s market. CEPA offers unprecedented market access for Indian goods with zero-duty access on 98.08% of Oman’s tariff lines, covering 99.38% of India’s exports by value. It marks the first-ever commitment by any country on traditional medicine across all modes opening significant opportunities for India’s wellness sectors and AYUSH , which anchors India’s traditional medicine sector through a comprehensive institutional framework. For the first time, Oman has offered commitments across key mode 4 categories , high quality temporary entry and temporary stay commitments for intra-corporate transferees, and contractual service suppliers, business visitors and independent professionals and liberalised entry and stay for professionals in accountancy, taxation, architecture, medical and allied sectors. Besides, India has signed a series of major Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with global economies, strengthening its position in international trade and opening new markets for Indian businesses. India concluded a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with the United Kingdom in 2025. CETA provides an unprecedented duty-free access to 99% of India’s exports to the UK, covering nearly 100% of the trade value, benefiting sectors such as textiles, leather, marine products, gems, engineering goods, chemicals, and auto components. Notably, the agreement goes beyond goods and addresses services , a core strength of India’s economy. India exported over US$ 19.8 billion in services to the UK in 2023, and CETA promises to expand this further. Additionally, in a first by UK, mobility for professionals across IT, healthcare, finance, and education is being eased with CETA. This offers streamlined entry for contractual service suppliers, business visitors, intra-corporate transferees, independent professionals. Another major breakthrough is the Double Contribution Convention - that will save Indian firms and workers ₹4,000+ crore by removing the need for dual social security contributions. Marking its first FTA with four developed European nations, India signed a trade and economic partnership agreement with the EFTA countries- Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein - in 2024. The agreement improves market access for Indian pharmaceuticals, engineering goods, and services, backed by strong investment commitments, including USD 100 billion in investment and the creation of one million jobs in India. India’s Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with the United Arab Emirates , signed in 2022, has substantially reduced tariffs on over 90%of Indian exports- particularly in gems and jewellery, textiles, leather, and engineering goods- supporting the target of exceeding $100 billion in bilateral trade. With Australia, India concluded the Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (ECTA) in 2022, eliminating or reducing tariffs on most traded goods. The agreement has opened the Australian market to Indian textiles, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and agriculture. In Africa , India signed its first trade pact with the continent through the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation and Partnership Agreement (CECPA) with Mauritius in 2021. The agreement enables easier market access for Indian exporters while strengthening Mauritius’ role as a gateway to African markets. Besides these concluded agreements, several major economies are currently engaged in active negotiations with India to deepen trade and investment ties through FTAs and comprehensive economic partnerships. India and Israel signed the Terms of Reference for an FTA in November 2025. The proposed pact is expected to deepen cooperation in sectors such as fintech, agri-tech, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, machine learning, pharmaceuticals, space and defence. India and the United States continue discussions on a bilateral trade agreement, with rounds of talks held in 2025. Under the ambitious \"Mission 500\", both countries aim to more than double US-India trade to $500 billion by 2030 to be achieved by deepening the trade relationship across multiple sectors. India is also in discussion with European Union (EU) for an FTA. Technical discussions on key chapters of the FTA such as market access for goods, rules of origin, services, technical barriers to trade, trade and sustainable development etc. took place in December 2025. Discussions for the ASEAN -India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) is also underway, which holds potential to unleash the full economic potential of the member countries and further strengthen regional cooperation. The India- Australia Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) negotiations are advancing, covering a wide range of areas including goods, services and mobility, digital trade, rules of origin, legal and institutional provisions, environment, labour, and gender, bringing greater understanding for convergence in the remaining provisions. India and Mexico meetings have been centered on strengthening bilateral trade and investment relations, with discussions focused on expanding trade, investment, expanding economic cooperation, fostering business collaborations, and exploring opportunities across diverse sectors. Negotiations are also underway with New Zealand for an FTA or Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement with key tracks including trade in goods, trade in services, economic and trade cooperation, and rules of origin. The proposed FTA is expected to significantly enhance trade flows, deepen investment linkages, strengthen supply-chain resilience, and provide greater predictability and market access for businesses. With Canada , India continues discussions on a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, supported by agreed terms of reference. The proposed agreement aims to raise bilateral trade to around $50 billion by 2030 through tariff reductions and clearer frameworks for services and investment. India is actively negotiating an FTA with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and exploring a similar arrangement with Qatar , with the objective of strengthening ties across trade, energy, investment, and security. The expanding network of concluded agreements and ongoing negotiations reflects a broader shift in India’s international economic engagement. Together, these partnerships position India to play a central role in shaping contemporary trade architectures anchored in mutual growth, resilience, and strategic trust. Boosting India’s Export Competitiveness The Government has implemented a comprehensive set of policy and institutional measures to strengthen India’s export ecosystem. These measures are strengthening India’s export competitiveness and integration with global markets. Export Promotion Mission The Export Promotion Mission , was approved on 12 November, 2025, with a total outlay of Rs.25,060 crore for FY 2025–26 to FY 2030–31. The mission operates through two integrated sub-schemes, Niryat Protsahan and Niryat Disha . Niryat Protsahan focuses on improving access to affordable trade finance for MSMEs through a range of instruments. Niryat Disha focuses on non-financial enablers that enhance market readiness and competitiveness, such as export quality and compliance support, assistance for international branding, packaging and others. Labour Reforms The integration of 29 labour laws into four Labour Codes has streamlined compliance, enhanced industrial efficiency, and strengthened worker protection. The reforms provide export-oriented industries with simplified regulations, flexible hiring provisions, unified registrations and returns, and expanded social security coverage, while ensuring occupational safety and welfare. At the same time, workers benefit from universal minimum wages, timely and transparent wage payments, mandatory appointment letters, grievance redressal mechanisms, and comprehensive social security protection. Next Gen GST 2.0 Reforms Since 22 September 2025, Next Gen GST 2.0 reforms have come into effect. 90% provisional refunds for zero rated supplies and inverted duty structure claims are being provided on a system driven, risk-based basis. The removal of value-based threshold limits for GST refunds on exports supports small exporters by enabling refund claims on low-value consignments. GST rate reductions across packaging materials, textiles, leather, wood, trucks, delivery vans, toys, and sports goods lower production, freight, and logistics costs, enhance export competitiveness, and support domestic manufacturing. Further, revised place of supply rules for “intermediary services” enables Indian service exporters to claim export related benefits, while correction of inverted duty structures in textiles and food processing eases working capital pressures and reduces refund dependency. India’s other export promotion schemes comprise targeted government initiatives to reduce costs, strengthen infrastructure, improve quality standards, and enhance export competitiveness. The Foreign Trade Policy 2023 provides incentive-based support, promotes market diversification, and enables closure of legacy authorisations, while the RoDTEP (Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products) scheme reimburses embedded duties and taxes, with ₹58,000 crore disbursed up to March 2025. Export ecosystems are being strengthened through the initiatives such as Districts as Export Hubs which are making states and districts active players in trade. 734 districts have been identified with export potential while District Export Action Plans (DEAP) has been prepared for 590 districts. The role of Special Economic Zones is also significant in the trade promotion, as it recorded exports of ₹14.56 lakh crore in FY 2024–25. Infrastructure and manufacturing competitiveness are being enhanced through the Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) , PM GatiShakti , the National Logistics Policy . The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, launched in 2020 is boosting manufacturing across 14 sectors, has attracted ₹1.76 lakh crore investments, generated ₹16.5 lakh crore in output, and created over 12 lakh jobs by March 2025. Further support is being provided through ease of doing business reforms and digital trade platforms such as the National Single Window System , Trade Connect e-Platform , E-Commerce Export Hubs , and ICEGATE . Conclusion India’s export performance between over the recent years reflects steady momentum, marked by diversification across products and markets and a balanced contribution from merchandise and services exports. The export basket recorded higher export values across major commodities. The export growth was accompanied by deeper engagement with key partner countries and emerging markets, supported by continued policy and procedural reforms. Together, these trends underscore India’s evolving export profile and its deepening integration with global trade networks.

India has inked a series of major Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), the most recent being the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with Oman. Active negotiations ongoing with several other countries. Export diversification is further poised to strengthen trade stability, competitiveness, and long-term economic security amid global uncertainties. India’s Trade Story at a Glance Driven by diversification, innovation, and strategic trade reforms, India continues to strengthen its position in global markets. From strong post-pandemic recovery to enduring global uncertainties, India’s exports are not just growing, they are setting new benchmarks. The year-on-year rise from November 2024 to November 2025 highlights India as a trusted and reliable partner in global trade . Between November 2024 and November 2025, India’s total exports rose from US$ 64.05 billion to US$ 73.99 billion , registering a strong 15.52% growth , while imports remained largely stable at US$ 80.63 billion. Consequently, the trade deficit narrowed significantly by 61.07% , from US$ 17.06 billion to US$ 6.64 billion.Despite trade disruption, this growth reflects India’s resilience, with high-value commodities, widening global partnerships, and policy reforms supporting a more balanced and globally integrated trade trajectory. For export growth India is also focused on enhancing its international trade relations. India's trade agreements with other economies reinforces its commitment to inclusive growth, benefiting farmers, artisans, workers, MSMEs while safeguarding core national interests. Most recently, the India–Oman agreement builds on long standing bilateral ties, creating a forward looking and balanced economic framework. Powering Global Trade: India’s Export Journey India’s exports recorded year-on-year growth in November 2025, reflecting sustained momentum in external trade. The increase was supported by higher export values across key merchandise and services sectors, alongside steady demand from major partner countries. This performance underscores the resilience of India’s export sector amid evolving global trade conditions. Merchandise exports during November 2025 were US$ 38.13 Billion as compared to US$ 31.94 Billion in November 2024, registering a growth of 19.38% over the year. Services export for November 2025 is US$ 35.86 Billion as compared to US$ 32.11 Billion in November 2024, indicating growth of 11.67% in a year. The share of merchandise exports was 51.53%, whereas service exports constituted 48.47% share in total exports in November 2025. Readymade garments of all textiles , a labor-intensive sector, continue to contribute positively. Exports rose to USD 1247.37 Million with 11.27% increase in November 2025 compared to last year.Some of the large export markets for India which clocked impressive growth rates were UAE (14.5%), UK (1.5%), Japan (19.0%), Germany (2.9%), Spain (9.0%) and France (9.2%). On the other hand, some of the other markets that recorded higher growth rates were Egypt (27%), Saudi Arabia (12.5%), Hong Kong (69%) etc. This performance highlights the sector’s adaptability and competitiveness in the face of global uncertainties. Similarly, Organic and Inorganic Chemicals exports grew by 18.49% over the year in November 2025. India’s drugs and pharmaceutical sector which is recognised as the Pharmacy of the World,  experienced 20.19% growth in exports over the year. Indian pharma exports are destined to more than 200 countries around the globe including highly regulated markets of US, West Europe, Japan and Australia indicating diversification in this sector too. Export of Gems and Jewellery also registered a growth of 27.8% in November, 2025. Indian jewellery is admired for its craftsmanship, design, and cultural richness. Demand is growing in key markets such as the United States, United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, and Europe, especially for gold, diamond, and coloured gemstone jewellery. India has witnessed a remarkable surge in petroleum product exports over the last decade. India is the seventh-largest exporter of refined petroleum products and ranks among the top five refining nations globally, due to its robust infrastructure and strategic geographic location. The export growth in November 2025 was 11.65% when compared from the corresponding year in the last year. Key export destinations include South Asian, African, and European countries. Engineering goods , a traditional pillar of India’s exports, have recorded steady growth, with the US as the top destination, followed by the UAE, Germany, the UK, and Saudi Arabia. To sustain momentum, the government has rolled out measures such as Zero Duty EPCG and the Market Access Initiative (MAI) to support exporters and boost overseas revenues. With a target of building a $500 billion domestic electronics ecosystem by 2030-31 , India is now firmly on track to become a global leader in electronic design, manufacturing, and exports. Leading the way are mobile phones from just ₹1,500 crore in 2014-15, mobile phone exports reached ₹2 lakh crore in 2024-25, growing 127 times in a single decade. Indian electronics goods are now exported to major markets, with the top five destinations in FY 2024-25 being the United States, United Arab Emirates, Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Italy. Export Diversification: A Strategic Approach Export diversification has emerged as a deliberate policy strategy. It helps navigate uncertain global trade environments marked by geopolitical tensions, demand volatility, and supply chain disruptions. By expanding across products and markets, countries reduce overdependence on limited partners and build resilience against external shocks. This approach strengthens trade stability, competitiveness, and long-term economic security amid global uncertainties. Avoiding export instability and reducing dependency Commodity dependent exports are inherently exposed to sharp price fluctuations, which can lead to instability in export earnings if countries rely on a narrow set of products. Such volatility may heighten macroeconomic uncertainty and dampen long-term investment decisions. Export diversification offers a pathway to greater stability by spreading risk across products and markets, thereby supporting sustained export growth and long-term economic resilience . Building resilience against global demand shocks Building resilience against global demand shocks is crucial, as limited export diversification can leave economies vulnerable to sudden downturns in global demand. Diversifying exports enhances the ability to absorb such economic shocks by spreading risk across sectors and markets, thereby ensuring greater stability in export performance. Encouraging knowledge spillover Export diversification fosters flow of ideas, skills, and information by encouraging the adoption of new production techniques, management practices, and marketing capabilities that can diffuse across industries. By expanding the range of export products, economies strengthen learning, innovation, and productivity, supporting higher per capita income growth over the long term. Strengthening macroeconomic stability Exports alone accounted for 21.2% of India’s GDP in 2024. Limited diversification can expose the economy to global uncertainties and export shortfalls, affecting macroeconomic stability. Export diversification strengthens stability by broadening economic activity, reducing vulnerability to external shocks, and supporting sustainable growth and improved living standards. Expanding Global Ties: Unlocking Trade Opportunities for India As India’s economic footprint continues to expand worldwide, it has emerged as a preferred partner for deeper trade and economic collaboration. India and Oman sign CEPA: India’s 2nd FTA in the last 6 months after UK DID YOU KNOW? Oman is a key pillar of India’s West Asia Policy and India’s oldest strategic partner in the region. The strong economic partnership is reflected in 6,000+ India–Oman joint ventures operating in Oman. India signed a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with Oman on 18 December 2025, marking a significant step in strengthening economic engagement with the Gulf region, as the two countries commemorate 70 years of diplomatic relations. The agreement underscores India’s growing stature as a trusted and dependable global trade partner. The agreement opens new export opportunities for India’s labour-intensive sectors- such as agriculture, textiles, leather, gems and jewellery, engineering, pharmaceuticals, and automobiles- supporting job creation and empowering artisans, women-led enterprises, and MSMEs. India held a 10.24% share in Oman’s agricultural imports in 2024, ranking second among suppliers. Major export items include Basmati rice, parboiled rice, bananas, potatoes, onions, meal of soyabean, sweet biscuits, cashew kernels, mixed condiments, butter, fish body oil, prawn & shrimps feed, frozen boneless bovine meat, and fertilized eggs. Duty free access to boneless meat of bovine animals, other fresh eggs, sweet biscuits, cashew kernels, other fats & oils derived from milk, other mixed condiments & seasonings, prepared/preserved potatoes, other egg yolks not dried, guar gum, kabuli chana and other cheese provide a competitive edge over other countries exporting to Oman. Elimination of the tariff from butter, sugar confectionery, bakery products, poultry meat & offal, mixed condiments & mixed seasoning, other fruit squash prepared/preserved, natural honey strengthens India’s position in Oman’s market. CEPA offers unprecedented market access for Indian goods with zero-duty access on 98.08% of Oman’s tariff lines, covering 99.38% of India’s exports by value. It marks the first-ever commitment by any country on traditional medicine across all modes opening significant opportunities for India’s wellness sectors and AYUSH , which anchors India’s traditional medicine sector through a comprehensive institutional framework. For the first time, Oman has offered commitments across key mode 4 categories , high quality temporary entry and temporary stay commitments for intra-corporate transferees, and contractual service suppliers, business visitors and independent professionals and liberalised entry and stay for professionals in accountancy, taxation, architecture, medical and allied sectors. Besides, India has signed a series of major Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with global economies, strengthening its position in international trade and opening new markets for Indian businesses. India concluded a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with the United Kingdom in 2025. CETA provides an unprecedented duty-free access to 99% of India’s exports to the UK, covering nearly 100% of the trade value, benefiting sectors such as textiles, leather, marine products, gems, engineering goods, chemicals, and auto components. Notably, the agreement goes beyond goods and addresses services , a core strength of India’s economy. India exported over US$ 19.8 billion in services to the UK in 2023, and CETA promises to expand this further. Additionally, in a first by UK, mobility for professionals across IT, healthcare, finance, and education is being eased with CETA. This offers streamlined entry for contractual service suppliers, business visitors, intra-corporate transferees, independent professionals. Another major breakthrough is the Double Contribution Convention - that will save Indian firms and workers ₹4,000+ crore by removing the need for dual social security contributions. Marking its first FTA with four developed European nations, India signed a trade and economic partnership agreement with the EFTA countries- Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein - in 2024. The agreement improves market access for Indian pharmaceuticals, engineering goods, and services, backed by strong investment commitments, including USD 100 billion in investment and the creation of one million jobs in India. India’s Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with the United Arab Emirates , signed in 2022, has substantially reduced tariffs on over 90%of Indian exports- particularly in gems and jewellery, textiles, leather, and engineering goods- supporting the target of exceeding $100 billion in bilateral trade. With Australia, India concluded the Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (ECTA) in 2022, eliminating or reducing tariffs on most traded goods. The agreement has opened the Australian market to Indian textiles, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and agriculture. In Africa , India signed its first trade pact with the continent through the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation and Partnership Agreement (CECPA) with Mauritius in 2021. The agreement enables easier market access for Indian exporters while strengthening Mauritius’ role as a gateway to African markets. Besides these concluded agreements, several major economies are currently engaged in active negotiations with India to deepen trade and investment ties through FTAs and comprehensive economic partnerships. India and Israel signed the Terms of Reference for an FTA in November 2025. The proposed pact is expected to deepen cooperation in sectors such as fintech, agri-tech, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, machine learning, pharmaceuticals, space and defence. India and the United States continue discussions on a bilateral trade agreement, with rounds of talks held in 2025. Under the ambitious \"Mission 500\", both countries aim to more than double US-India trade to $500 billion by 2030 to be achieved by deepening the trade relationship across multiple sectors. India is also in discussion with European Union (EU) for an FTA. Technical discussions on key chapters of the FTA such as market access for goods, rules of origin, services, technical barriers to trade, trade and sustainable development etc. took place in December 2025. Discussions for the ASEAN -India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) is also underway, which holds potential to unleash the full economic potential of the member countries and further strengthen regional cooperation. The India- Australia Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) negotiations are advancing, covering a wide range of areas including goods, services and mobility, digital trade, rules of origin, legal and institutional provisions, environment, labour, and gender, bringing greater understanding for convergence in the remaining provisions. India and Mexico meetings have been centered on strengthening bilateral trade and investment relations, with discussions focused on expanding trade, investment, expanding economic cooperation, fostering business collaborations, and exploring opportunities across diverse sectors. Negotiations are also underway with New Zealand for an FTA or Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement with key tracks including trade in goods, trade in services, economic and trade cooperation, and rules of origin. The proposed FTA is expected to significantly enhance trade flows, deepen investment linkages, strengthen supply-chain resilience, and provide greater predictability and market access for businesses. With Canada , India continues discussions on a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, supported by agreed terms of reference. The proposed agreement aims to raise bilateral trade to around $50 billion by 2030 through tariff reductions and clearer frameworks for services and investment. India is actively negotiating an FTA with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and exploring a similar arrangement with Qatar , with the objective of strengthening ties across trade, energy, investment, and security. The expanding network of concluded agreements and ongoing negotiations reflects a broader shift in India’s international economic engagement. Together, these partnerships position India to play a central role in shaping contemporary trade architectures anchored in mutual growth, resilience, and strategic trust. Boosting India’s Export Competitiveness The Government has implemented a comprehensive set of policy and institutional measures to strengthen India’s export ecosystem. These measures are strengthening India’s export competitiveness and integration with global markets. Export Promotion Mission The Export Promotion Mission , was approved on 12 November, 2025, with a total outlay of Rs.25,060 crore for FY 2025–26 to FY 2030–31. The mission operates through two integrated sub-schemes, Niryat Protsahan and Niryat Disha . Niryat Protsahan focuses on improving access to affordable trade finance for MSMEs through a range of instruments. Niryat Disha focuses on non-financial enablers that enhance market readiness and competitiveness, such as export quality and compliance support, assistance for international branding, packaging and others. Labour Reforms The integration of 29 labour laws into four Labour Codes has streamlined compliance, enhanced industrial efficiency, and strengthened worker protection. The reforms provide export-oriented industries with simplified regulations, flexible hiring provisions, unified registrations and returns, and expanded social security coverage, while ensuring occupational safety and welfare. At the same time, workers benefit from universal minimum wages, timely and transparent wage payments, mandatory appointment letters, grievance redressal mechanisms, and comprehensive social security protection. Next Gen GST 2.0 Reforms Since 22 September 2025, Next Gen GST 2.0 reforms have come into effect. 90% provisional refunds for zero rated supplies and inverted duty structure claims are being provided on a system driven, risk-based basis. The removal of value-based threshold limits for GST refunds on exports supports small exporters by enabling refund claims on low-value consignments. GST rate reductions across packaging materials, textiles, leather, wood, trucks, delivery vans, toys, and sports goods lower production, freight, and logistics costs, enhance export competitiveness, and support domestic manufacturing. Further, revised place of supply rules for “intermediary services” enables Indian service exporters to claim export related benefits, while correction of inverted duty structures in textiles and food processing eases working capital pressures and reduces refund dependency.
