                17 DEC 2025 3:08PM by PIB Delhi Your Excellency, the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Honourable Speakers of both Houses of Parliament, Honourable Members, Excellencies, and my dear sisters and brothers of Ethiopia, It is a moment of great privilege for me to stand before you today. It is wonderful to be here in Ethiopia, the land of lions. I feel very much at home. Because my home state Gujarat in India, is also home to Lions. I am honoured to be here, in this temple of democracy, in the heart of a nation with ancient wisdom and modern aspirations. And, I come to you with deep respect for your Parliament, your people, and your democratic journey. On behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India, I bring greetings of friendship, goodwill, and brotherhood. I bring greetings of friendship, goodwill, and brotherhood. तेना इस्तील्लीन सलाम Honourable Members, In this great building, your laws are shaped. Here, the will of the people becomes the will of the state. And when the will of the state is in harmony with the will of the people, the wheel of progress moves forward with hope and purpose. Through you, I am also speaking to your farmers in the fields, To the entrepreneurs building new ideas, to the proud women leading communities and institutions, and, to the young people of Ethiopia who are shaping the future. I thank you for this immense privilege. Yesterday, I was also honoured to receive the Grand Honor, Nishan of Ethiopia, from my dear friend Prime Minister Dr. Abiy Ahmed. I accept this award with folded hands, with humility, on behalf of the people of India. आम सग्नालो Honourable Members, Ethiopia is one of the oldest civilisations in human history. Here, history is alive in the mountains, in the valleys, and in the hearts of the Ethiopian people. Today, Ethiopia stands tall because its roots are deep. To stand in Ethiopia is to stand where the past is honoured, the present is full of purpose, and the future is welcomed with open hearts. This blend of old and new... This balance between ancient wisdom and modern ambition... This is the true strength of Ethiopia. This spirit of मेडेमर, or synergy, is very familiar to us in India. Like the monolithic churches of लालिबेला, the ancient rock temples of Tamil Nadu in India are also prayers set in stone. We too are an ancient civilisation, walking confidently into the future. With the call of सबका साथ, सबका विकास, सबका विश्वास, सबका प्रयास। Together, for everyone’s growth, with everyone’s trust and effort. Our emotions for our motherland, also reflect our shared perspectives. India’s national song Vande Mataram, and the Ethiopian national anthem, both refer to our land as the mother. They inspire us to take pride in the heritage, culture, natural beauty and protect the motherland. Honourable Members, Science has traced some of the earliest footprints of our species in Ethiopia. When the world speaks of Lucy, of दिन्किनेश they are not speaking only of a fossil. They are speaking of a beginning. A beginning that belongs to all of us, whether we live in आडिस अबाबा or in Ayodhya. In India, we say Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, the world is one family. It reminds us that beyond politics, beyond borders, beyond differences, we share a common origin. And if our beginning was shared, then our destiny must also be shared. Honourable Members, India and Ethiopia share warmth in climate, as well as in spirit. Nearly two thousand years ago, our ancestors built connections across great waters. Across the Indian Ocean, merchants sailed with spices, cotton, coffee, and gold. But, they traded more than goods. They exchanged ideas, stories, and ways of life. Ports like अदूलिस and Dholera were not just trade centres. They were bridges between civilisations. In modern times, our relationship entered a new era. Indian soldiers fought alongside Ethiopians for the liberation of Ethiopia in 1941. Our formal diplomatic relations began soon after India became independent. But even before embassies were set up, our people had already started writing a new chapter together. Thousands of Indian teachers came to Ethiopia. They taught children in आडिस अबाबा, in दिरे दावा, from बाहिर दार to मेकेले. They reached Ethiopian schools, and entered Ethiopian hearts. Even today, many Ethiopian parents speak warmly about Indian teachers who shaped the future of their children. And just as Indian teachers came here, Ethiopian students also travelled to India, seeking knowledge and friendship. They went to India as students and returned home as the builders of modern Ethiopia. I am told that some of them are present here in this Parliament right now! Including the Honourable Speaker तागेसे चाफो. They have also played a special role in building our people-to-people ties. Because they introduced Ethiopian cuisine in India. In India, we also enjoy eating ""श्री अन्न” millets like Ragi and Bajra. So, the flavour of Ethiopian टेफ is very comforting for us. And, since we enjoy eating the Indian Thali, the Ethiopian बेया-नैतू also feels very familiar to us. Honourable Members, Today, Indian companies are among the largest foreign investors in Ethiopia. They have invested more than five billion dollars in diverse sectors like textiles, manufacturing, agriculture, health, and more. And, they have created more than seventy-five thousand local jobs. But, I am sure we can all agree, our partnership has a lot more potential. That is why, Prime Minister Dr. Abiy Ahmed and I took a big step forward yesterday. We have decided to elevate our bilateral relationship to the level of a Strategic Partnership. This will unleash the potential of our economies, through cooperation in technology, innovation, mining, sustainability, and clean energy. It will also help secure the future for our peoples through cooperation in food security, health security and capacity building. In addition, we will also enhance our trade and investment cooperation, as well as on defence and security matters. Honourable Members, As developing countries, we have a lot to learn from and offer to each other. Agriculture forms the backbone of our two nations. It feeds our people. It sustains our farmers. It connects tradition with innovation. We can work together to develop better seeds, irrigation systems and soil-health technologies. As climate change affects rainfall and crop cycles, we can share knowledge in climate-resilient farming. From dairy farming to farm mechanisation, from millet research to food processing, together, we can help our farmers prosper. Honourable Members, In India, we have built a robust Digital Public Infrastructure. It has transformed the way we deliver services and how people access them. Today, every citizen in India can use technology for payments, for identity, and for government services. More than half of the world’s real-time digital payments now happen in India. Welfare benefits worth over 500 billion dollars have reached hundreds of millions of beneficiaries directly in their bank accounts, without leakages or corruption. Three times every year, nearly 100 million farmers receive financial assistance at the click of a button. As you roll out the Digital Ethiopia 2025 Strategy, we are ready to share our expertise and our experience with Ethiopia. And, we are honoured that you have picked India as the trusted partner to develop the Data Centre for your Foreign Ministry. Honourable Members, India is known as the pharmacy of the world. During the Covid pandemic, the entire world was worried. It was a very difficult time. Despite limited resources, we considered it our sacred duty to humanity to do everything possible to help others. India sent medicines and vaccines to more than 150 countries. It was India’s proud privilege to supply Ethiopia with over 4 million vaccine doses. And, our good fortune to do so in partnership with the W.H.O led by डॉक्टर टेडरोस, a proud son of Ethiopia, known in India as तुलसी भाई. I am glad that our healthcare cooperation is growing, from pharmaceuticals to hospitals, and from traditional medicine to telemedicine. We are committed to strengthen our health security cooperation further - from provisioning of new equipment in hospitals, to capacity building of healthcare professionals. Honourable Members, Ethiopia sits at a crossroads of Africa. India stands at the heart of the Indian Ocean. We are natural partners in regional peace, security, and connectivity. Our commitment to mutual security became stronger with the signing of the Defence Cooperation Agreement earlier this year. This agreement focuses on closer military cooperation. It includes collaboration in cybersecurity, in defence industries, in joint research, and in capacity building. I take this opportunity to thank Ethiopia for your solidarity after the terrorist attack in India in Pahalgam in April. I also thank you for receiving our All Party Parliamentary Delegation so warmly, and for affirming the commitment of Zero Tolerance towards terrorism. Honourable Members, As vibrant and diverse democracies, we both understand that democracy is a way of life, and it is a journey. It is shaped sometimes by debate, sometimes by disagreement, but always by belief in the rule of law and the will of the people. Both our constitutions also reflect this spirit. India’s Constitution begins with the words: ""We, the People of India.” Ethiopia’s Constitution begins with: ""We, the Nations, Nationalities and Peoples of Ethiopia.” Their message is the same: our destiny is in our hands. This morning, I had the honor to lay a wreath at the आड्वा Victory Monument. This monument is a timeless reminder of how Ethiopia’s victory inspired the entire colonised world in its quest for dignity and freedom. And in these times of conflict and uncertainty, it is a reminder that the people of the Global South can stand up for themselves. Honourable Members, Mahatma Gandhi gave us the concept of trusteeship. We do not own this beautiful planet and its resources. Instead, we are trustees who must take care of them and pass them to our children. The spirit of trusteeship that guides India’s ""एक पेड़ माँ के नाम” - ""A Tree for Mother” initiative - is also reflected in Ethiopia’s Green Legacy Initiative. Both our nations believe in caring for Mother Earth. Both believe in giving back to nature. Together, let us work on renewable energy and green jobs. Let us work on disaster resilient infrastructure and bio-fuels. And let us raise a strong voice for climate justice. India will be happy to support Ethiopia’s efforts to give a powerful voice to the Global South at COP-32 in 2027. Honourable Members, I am told that there is a saying in Ethiopia, ""When spider webs unite, they can tie up a lion.” We too believe in India, that मन मिलें तो पर्वत भी रास्ता दे देते हैं - when hearts are united, even mountains give way. Indeed, solidarity is strength, and cooperation is power. And today, as nations of the Global South, as ancient civilisations, as friends, India and Ethiopia are standing together. We stand together as members of one family. And we work for a world that is more just, more equal, and more peaceful. It was here, in आडिस अबाबा, that the dreams of African unity found a home. I am told that many streets of this wonderful city are even named after African countries! On the other side of the Indian Ocean, it was in New Delhi, that India was honoured to welcome the African Union as a permanent member of the G20. Last year, we marked another historic step with the inclusion of Ethiopia as a full member of the BRICS. In fact, over the 11 years of my government, the connection between India and Africa has grown manifold. During this period, we have exchanged more than 100 visits at the level of Heads of State and Government. Honourable Members, The Global South is writing its own destiny. And, India and Ethiopia share a vision for it. Our vision is of a world where the Global South rises not against anyone, but for everyone. A world where development is fair, where technology is accessible, and where sovereignty is respected. A world where prosperity is shared, and peace is defended. And, a world where decision-making reflects today’s reality, not the world of 1945. Because the world cannot move forward if its systems remain locked in the past. That is why, India has emphasized a Global Development Compact. It will prioritize technology sharing, affordable finance, capacity building, and trade for sustainable growth. That is why, at the G-20 Summit in November, I called for an ""Africa Skills Multiplier Initiative”, to train one million trainers. It will build local capacities, and help your efforts towards inclusive and sustainable development. Honourable Members, My personal association with tea is well-known. But, it is impossible to come to Ethiopia and not mention coffee! It is one of your greatest gifts to the world! In an Ethiopian coffee ceremony, people sit together, time slows down, and friendships deepen. In India too, a cup of tea is an invitation to talk, to share, to connect. And, just like Ethiopian coffee and Indian tea, our friendship is brewing stronger! Today, I stand before you, among sisters and brothers, with a deep sense of gratitude, and bright hopes for the future. The future is calling. And, India and Ethiopia are ready to answer. Honourable Members, As I conclude, I give you my word, that we will walk together as equals. We will build together as partners. And, we will succeed together as friends. Thank you for the honour of addressing this Parliament. Thank you for your friendship. Thank you for your trust. तब्बारकु देना हुन्नु आम सग्नालो Thank you. *** MJPS/ST (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205184) आगंतुक पटल  : 199 इस विज्ञप्ति को इन भाषाओं में पढ़ें: Gujarati Prime Minister's Office Text of Prime Minister’s address at Joint session of Parliament of Ethiopia प्रविष्टि तिथि:

                17 DEC 2025 4:45PM by PIB Delhi During the last 5 years (December 2020 to December 2025), 22 ISRO satellites have been launched. Out of which 7 are Earth Observation, 4 are communication, 2 are navigation, 3 are space science and 6 are technology demonstration missions. The details of the launches are attached in Annexure-1. There has been no cost overrun in Chandrayaan-3 and Aditya-L1 satellite projects. However, there has been time overrun of 28 and 46 months respectively for Chandrayaan-3 and Aditya-L1 satellites, mainly due to the following reasons: Aditya-L1: Time overrun in the project is due to change in the scope, change in orbit from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to Lagrangian Point (L1) calling for changes in the satellite configuration, longer cycle for the payload development and procurement of long lead items. Chandrayaan-3: Time overrun is due to reconfiguration of systems to incorporate suggested by Chandrayaan-2 Failure Analysis Committee, COVID-19 Pandemic, Conduct of New Special Test and New Sensor development. Gaganyaan Programme aims to demonstrate indigenous human spaceflight capability to Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The programme was officially sanctioned by the Government of India in January 2019 with a mandate to undertake two uncrewed missions in identical configuration and one crewed mission with total budget approval of ₹9,023 Crore with target schedule of crewed mission launch in May 2022. Recently in October 2024, the scope of Gaganyaan programme was revised from three to eight mission including additional uncrewed mission (G1) and also four precursor missions for Bharatiya Antariksh Station (BAS) with total revised budget provision of ₹20,193Crore. The activities as per revised approval is in progress with target of first Crewed mission in year 2027-28. For the Gaganyaan programme, ISRO is developing and realising various systems for accomplishing the planned missions. Considering the stringent human rating requirements, extensive testing of propulsion elements, structures of Human-Rated Launch Vehicle (HLVM3), Service Module Propulsion System and Crew Module Propulsion System, parachute-based deceleration system has been completed. The critical Crew Escape System motors have also been developed and static tests have been completed. In parallel, development of indigenous Environmental Control and Life Support Systems is in progress. Major infrastructure such as the Orbital Module Preparation Facility, Gaganyaan Control Centre, Crew training facility have been established. Second launch pad modifications have been incorporated. Precursor missions such as TV-D1 and IADT-01 have been successfully accomplished. Ground tracking networks, terrestrial links and IDRSS-1 feeder stations have been established. Crew Module Recovery plan as well as assets to be deployed have been finalized. For the first uncrewed mission (G1), all HLVM3 stages and CES motors are ready. Crew and Service Module systems have been realized. Assembly and integration activities are nearing completion. The first crewed mission is targeted in 2027-28. India has achieved self-reliance in space transportation systems to launch satellites up to 10 tons to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and 4.2 tons to Geo-Synchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) through the currently operational PSLV, GSLV and LVM3 launch vehicles. These launch vehicles have enabled independent space access to satellites for earth observation, communication, navigation and space exploration. In order to enhance the launch vehicle capabilities towards meeting the expanded space vision, Government has approved the development of a Next Generation Launch Vehicle (NGLV) which will provide a maximum payload capability of 30 tons to Low Earth Orbit. Towards achieving low-cost access to space, reusable launch vehicle technologies are also being developed including a partially reusable variant of NGLV with 14 tons payload capability to LEO. Another development is of a winged body upper stage which will fly back from the orbit to the Earth and autonomously land on a runway. With regard to development of more powerful and more efficient propulsion systems, ISRO has undertaken the development of a high-thrust (2000kN) semi-cryogenic engine for inducting in the LVM3 vehicle. An environmentally friendly Methane based propulsion system for high-thrust engine is also being conceptualized for the Next Generation Launch Vehicle, ensuring technology readiness for the launch vehicle for the proposed Crewed Moon Mission. Apart from these, development of an air-breathing propulsion system is underway towards a Dual-Fuel Scramjet engine. The Government proposes to increase budget allocation for critical space infrastructure and R&D projects of the Department of Space. The Space Vision 2047 of the Government targets establishment of the Bharatiya Antariksh Station by 2035 and landing of an Indian on Moon by 2040. Towards this, Government has approved five key R&D intensive projects: the Gaganyaan follow-on mission; the Chandrayaan follow-on missions including Chandrayaan-4 Lunar Sample Return Mission and the Chandrayaan-5/LUPEX mission; the Venus Orbiter Mission; and the development of the Next Generation Launch Vehicle. As part of the expansion of ground infrastructure for achieving the Space Vision, Government has approved two more launch pads – one at Kulasekarapattinam in Tamil Nadu and a Third Launch Pad for the next generation of Launch Vehicles. **** NKR/AK Annexure-1 List of satellites launched during last 5 years Sl.

With a view to optimally utilise limited uranium reserves and large thorium reserves in the country, the Department of Atomic Energy has adopted a three-stage nuclear power programme, based on a closed nuclear fuel cycle, for generation of nuclear power and for achieving long term energy security. The three-stage nuclear power programme, which is to be implemented sequentially, aims to multiply the domestically available fissile resources through the use of natural Uranium in Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (first stage), followed by use of Plutonium obtained from the spent fuel of Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors in Fast Breeder Reactors, in the second stage. Large scale use of Thorium will subsequently follow making use of Uranium- 233 that will be bred in Fast Breeder Reactors, when adequate nuclear installed capacity in the country has been built.  Accordingly, the utilisation of Thorium as a practically inexhaustible energy source has been contemplated during the third stage of the Indian nuclear programme, which can be reached in future. The first stage of nuclear power programme comprising indigenous Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) is in industrial domain.

                17 DEC 2025 2:00PM by PIB Delhi Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) a Constituent Unit of Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) by using radiation induced mutagenesis along with cross breeding, has developed 72 improved crop varieties in oilseeds (groundnut, mustard, soybean and sunflower), pulses (urdbean, mungbean, pigeonpea and cowpea), rice, jute and banana, which have been released and notified for commercial cultivation. These crop varieties have desirable traits such as high yield, early maturity, resistant to lodging, biotic & abiotic stress tolerance etc. and thus benefiting farmers in the country. In the last five (5) years (i.e. from 2020-2025), by employing radiation-induced mutagenesis, DAE has developed and released a total of 23 varieties for cultivation by farmers. These include (a) 7 rice varieties, (b) 5 mustard varieties, (c) 3 black gram (urad) varieties, (d) 3 sorghum (jowar) varieties, (e) 2 groundnut varieties, (f) one mung bean variety, (g) one sesamum (til) variety and (h) one banana variety. In the last five (5) years, a total 1680 quintals of breeder seeds of Trombay crop varieties, including groundnut, mungbean, rice and mustard varieties, were produced for distribution to seed corporations/companies and farmers for multiplication for cultivation by farmers. The estimated quantity of seeds available to farmers for cultivation is around 18,05,300 quintals. These estimates are based on the expected multiplication ratios observed during production of foundation seeds from breeder seeds and subsequently, certified seeds from foundation seeds. Radiation-based food-preservation technologies involving irradiation, and subsequent cold storage, developed by BARC are being employed for extending the shelf life of perishable agriculture produce, mitigate post-harvest and storage losses of agriculture produce. Irradiation of grains and spices eliminates insects and microbes and is a useful method of chemical free preservation. The technology is being deployed to facilitate; Export of agriculture produce such as mangoes, pomegranates to countries like United States of America (USA), Australia etc., through sea route in an economical manner. Shelf-life extension of spices, grains, vegetables, fruits, onions and potatoes. Shelf-life extension processed food products. Forty-one (41) food irradiation and medical product sterilization facilities have already been commissioned in private/State Government sectors in the country and they are providing radiation processing services on demand basis. DAE has been involved in the use of radiations and radioisotopes in agriculture through continuous R&D programmes. In field of nuclear agriculture, development and field trials of radiation induced improved crops are implemented in collaboration with various State Agricultural Universities, as well as research institutes under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). BARC developed radiation technologies not only extend shelf life and prevent post harvesting losses, but also helps India meet international quarantine requirements for perishable commodities, enabling access to high-value markets. India has been exporting mangoes and pomegranate to the USA, Australia, South Africa and Malaysia using irradiation as a mandatory phytosanitary treatment. These measures strengthen export-oriented value chains and boost incomes of farmers and traders. BARC is involved in developing comprehensive Standard Operating Protocols (SOPs) for the irradiation of agricultural produce to achieve shelf-life extension, reduction of post-harvest losses, and improvement in marketability. Overall, the Government's initiatives, including R&D collaborations, establishment of irradiation infrastructure, and promotion of export-oriented radiation processing, are helping to strengthen national food security, reduce wastage, improve farmer incomes, and enhance India’s competitiveness in global agri-trade. **** NKR/AK (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205121) आगंतुक पटल  : 105 इस विज्ञप्ति को इन भाषाओं में पढ़ें: Urdu Department of Atomic Energy PARLIAMENT QUESTION: NUCLEAR SCIENCE FOR AGRICULTURE AND FOOD PRESERVATION प्रविष्टि तिथि:

                17 DEC 2025 5:13PM by PIB Delhi The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) issued a Direction on 16 th December, 2025 mandating that the entities regulated by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) should adopt ‘1600’ series numbers by the last date of 15 th February, 2026 for making service and transactional calls to the consumers. The Direction has been issued with the objective of enhancing consumer trust, curbing spam, and preventing fraudulent activities perpetrated through voice calls. The mandate for last date has been issued in consultation with IRDAI. Earlier TRAI had issued similar Directions for mandatory adoptions of 1600 series numbers by entities regulated by RBI, SEBI and PFRDA. In response to TRAI’s regulatory initiative, the ‘1600’ numbering series has been assigned by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) for allocation to entities in the Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) sector, and Government organizations to clearly distinguish their service and transactional calls from other commercial communications. The series will enable citizens to reliably identify legitimate calls originating from regulated financial entities. After the assignment of the series and allocation of numbering resources to the Telecom Service Providers (TSPs), TRAI has regularly engaged with TSPs and the BFSI sector regulators for adoption of 1600 series by BFSI sector entities. Consequent to these efforts, about 570 entities have already adopted 1600 series numbers, subscribing to a total of over 3000 numbers. Based on TRAI’s interactions with stakeholders, it was considered that time is now ripe to mandate timebound completion of the exercise so that entities continuing to use standard 10-digit numbers for service and transactional calls, also shift to 1600 series numbers to reduce the risk of fraudulent or misleading calls being made in the guise of trusted financial institutions. TRAI has taken input regarding timelines from the IRDAI, following deliberations held during the meetings of the Joint Committee of Regulators (JCoR). Based on the consultations held with them, an implementation schedule has now been issued. The structured and time-bound adoption of the 1600-series will significantly improve consumer safety and help curb impersonation-based financial frauds perpetrated through voice calls. **** MI/ARJ (Release ID: 2205350) Visitor Counter : 4 Ministry of Communications TRAI issues Direction mandating adoption of 1600-series by entities regulated by IRDAI Posted On:

PACS are developed as hubs for delivering benefits from schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana(PMFBY), Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samriddhi Kendra (PMKSK), interest subvention, fertiliser and seed distribution, PDS outlets, LPG/Petrol/Diesel dealerships, custom hiring, PM Jan Aushadhi Kendras, Common Service Centres, etc.. and Integration with the state specific portal like, Bhulekh portal (In U.P and M.P), e-KYC and e-Uparjan (M.P), e-Crop, CCRC (Andra Pradesh) and other schemes of other States and also with the Cooperative Banking systems. Various steps taken to convert PACS into multi-service centres for farmers in Bihar, are as under: Under State Plan in Bihar, 7,221 Godowns have been constructed in PACS throughout the state creating storage capacity of 17.14 Lakh MT, thereby fortifying the physical infrastructure. 278 Godowns carrying storage capacity of 2.49 lakh MT have been sanctioned during present FY 2025-26. Further, 36 PACS with capacity of 1,33,500 MT have been identified by Cooperative Department, Govt. of Bihar under the World’s Largest Grain Storage Plan (WLGSP). 5256 PACS are functioning as Common Service Centres providing services on banking education, Digi Pay, IRCTC, Electricity bill, KVK crop health care etc. 12 PACS have applied for petrol/diesel retail outlets in CC2/open category, and 05 PACS have been selected by Oil Marketing Companies. Out of 412 applications received from PACS as PM Jan Aushadhi Kendras, drug license has been issued to 30 PACS and currently 21 Jan Aushadhi Kendra are operational in PACS. 2271 PACS have fertilizer license, out of which 1681 PACS have been upgraded as PM Kisan Samriddhi Kendras. These Kendras provides additional services such as soil testing, training etc. Under Financial Inclusion Fund, NABARD and Bihar State Cooperative Bank have sanctioned an amount of Rs. 1.76 cr for 785 micro-ATMs during FY 2024-25 and Rs.53.77 lakh for 239 micro-ATMs in FY 2025-26. Further, Rs. 22.11 lakh has been sanctioned for conducting 390 Financial Literacy Awareness Programmes (FLAPs) to DCCBs for organizing FLAPs for dissemination of financial literacy to rural population including farmers. During FY 2025-26, 130 FLAPs with grant assistance of Rs. 7.53 lakh have been sanctioned to DCCBs for conducting financial literacy under FIF (Financial Inclusion Fund). As per National Cooperative Database (NCD), out of 7,398 PACS working as Custom Hiring Centres in country, 2,661 centres are working in Bihar. Training and capacity-building programmes implemented through the National Council for Cooperative Training (NCCT) and its network of RICMs and ICMs aimed at strengthening governance, transparency, and member engagement in cooperative institutions. These programmes have resulted in demonstrable improvements in operational efficiency and professional competence across several States. Since the inception of the Ministry of Cooperation, NCCT institutes have trained 9,82,787 participants through 15,919 training programmes. With respect to the State of Bihar, RICM Patna, under NCCT, has trained 43,290 participants across various training programmes, covering a wide range of cooperative sectors. NCCT provided training programme for the secretaries of on boarded PACS in CSC Portal for providing 300 online services to the PACS members. Under this, 57 programmes were conducted in Bihar and 2096 PACS secretaries were trained in 2024-25. Through this training several PACS reported measurable benefits, enhanced service delivery, increased footfall, and improved inclusion of youth and women. Government subsidies provided through schemes such as Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF), Agriculture Marketing Infrastructure (AMI), Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM) for creating warehouses, custom hiring centers, primary processing units and other agri-infrastructure for grain storage at PACS level will reduce wastage of food grains and transportation costs, enable farmers to realize better prices for their produce and meet various agricultural needs at the PACS level itself. Further, NCDC has been providing financial assistance to the cooperative sector under its Corporation - sponsored schemes, covering a wide range of notified commodities and services, as amended from time to time. In recent years, NCDC has introduced sector-specific schemes and focused products to align with the evolving needs of the cooperative sector, with special emphasis on women empowerment, digitization of cooperatives, and rural healthcare. The combined impact of training and subsidies has resulted in improved transparency, better service delivery, and higher participation of members in cooperative activities The Ministry of Cooperation, since its inception has undertaken several important initiatives to improve the financial condition of cooperative societies, enhance their efficiency, and ensure transparency in their functioning, with the vision of “Sahakar se Samriddhi”. Despite substantial progress, cooperatives continue to face challenges such as limited professional management capacity, inadequate access to affordable credit, financial constraints in undertaking infrastructure projects, and the need to improve market linkages. To address these issues, the National Cooperation Policy (NCP) 2025 outlines a ten-year roadmap focused on accessible finance, multi-sector expansion, and technology-driven transparency. Financial stability is being further reinforced through measures such as reducing the surcharge for cooperatives with income between ₹1 crore and ₹10 crore from 12% to 7%, lowering the Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) from 18.5% to 15%, and introducing a concessional 15% tax rate for new manufacturing cooperatives established before March 31, 2024. For Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS) and Primary Cooperative Agriculture and Rural Development Banks (PCARDBs), the permissible limits for cash deposits, payments, loans and loan repayments have been enhanced from ₹20,000 to ₹2 lakh per member, easing their operational flexibility. Significant financial support has been extended for infrastructure development, including a total outlay of ₹2,925.39 crore for the computerisation of functional PACS. Under the Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure (AMI) Scheme, margin money requirements for PACS godowns have been reduced from 20% to 10%, subsidy rates have been increased from 25% to 33.33%, and an additional subsidy equal to one-third of the total admissible subsidy is provided for ancillary facilities such as internal roads and weighbridges. The Ministry has also facilitated the disbursal of ₹190 crore to Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) and ₹98 crore to Fish Farmer Producer Organisations (FFPOs) through National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC). Financial stability is being further reinforced through a ₹2,000 crore Government grant to NCDC, enabling mobilisation of ₹20,000 crore for cooperative lending, along with a new ₹24,000 crore NCDC scheme for 29,050 cooperative societies. Banking reforms, including allowing cooperative banks to adopt one-time settlements, CGTMSE-based collateral-free lending, and the creation of Sahakar Sarathi for providing shared technological services, are improving financial resilience. Efforts to diversify cooperative revenue streams through national multi-state cooperative federations such as BBSSL, NCOL and NCEL, and the establishment of the Tribhuvan Sahkari University (TSU) for professionalising cooperative leadership, are further strengthening the long-term financial stability and governance of cooperatives across the country. These measures aim to improve financial stability, enhance transparency, diversify revenue streams, and ensure long-term sustainability of cooperatives, including those in Bihar.

                        17 DEC 2025 1:11PM by PIB Delhi In order to realise the vision of ‘Sahakar Se Samriddhi’, the Ministry has taken various initiatives for development of Cooperative Sector. One such initiative is approval of the plan to establish new multipurpose PACS/dairy/fisheries cooperatives, aiming to cover all panchayats and villages in the country over the next five years, including the State of Odisha. As of November 15, 2025, a total of 30,083 new PACS, Dairy and Fishery Cooperative Societies have been registered; and 15,793 Dairy and Fisheries Cooperative Societies have been strengthened; 255,881 Gram Panchayats (GPs) are covered by PACS; 87,159 Gram Panchayats are covered by dairy cooperative societies; and 29,964 Gram Panchayats are covered by fisheries cooperative societies. In the State of Odisha total 2,039 new M-PACS (1537), Dairy (451) and Fisheries (51) Cooperative Societies have been registered and 209 Dairy Cooperative Societies are Strengthened. Under the Centrally Sponsored Project for the computerisation of functional PACS, Odisha has been sanctioned 4,240 PACS to be brought onto an ERP-based common national software aimed at improving transparency and operational efficiency. Women and tribal cooperatives in Odisha additionally benefit from national interest subvention schemes of NCDC. During the last three years, financial assistance, grants and credit facilities extended under national programmes have also been made available to the State of Odisha. NCDC has provided a total of ₹10.74 crore for cooperative development in the State, comprising ₹1.61 crore in 2022–23, ₹3.24 crore in 2023–24 and ₹5.89 crore in 2024–25 (Disbursement by NCDC during last 5 years is Attached at Annexure-I). Targeted support to women and tribal cooperatives has likewise been extended, with ₹0.20 crore disbursed over this period. This includes ₹35 lakh to the Self-Employment Mahila Cooperative Organisation Ltd., ₹31.80 lakh to Maa Sureswari Farmer Producer Cooperative Society Ltd., ₹2.50 lakh to Swaviman Primary Fisheries Cooperative Society (100% ST members) and ₹9.30 lakh to Gajapati Organic Farmer Producer Cooperative Society Ltd. (100% ST members). Additionally, ₹18.07 crore has been released as Central share to Odisha during FY 2025–26 under the PACS Computerisation Project. For training and capacity building of about 4106 PACS functionaries, assistance of ₹1.24 crore has been provided to the two Cooperative Training Institutes (CTIs) of Odisha i.e. Agriculture Cooperative Staff Training Institute (ACSTI) and Madhusudan Institute of Cooperative Management (MICM) for 135 training programmes for PACS. As on 15.11.2025, Odisha has 7,595 cooperative societies and 94,92,273 members across all districts. District-wise Cooperative Societies and Membership details in Odisha are attached as Annexure-II. Several measures being implemented nationwide, including in Odisha, aimed to strengthen the cooperative structure, promote agriculture-based entrepreneurship and reinforce the rural economy. These include continued implementation of the national plan to establish two lakh new multipurpose PACS, Dairy and Fishery Cooperatives to ensure cooperative presence in all uncovered Panchayats and villages. The rollout of the World’s Largest Decentralised Grain Storage Plan will convert PACS into infrastructure and service hubs with godowns, custom hiring centres and primary processing units, improving farmers’ post-harvest outcomes. Digital modernisation efforts across the sanctioned PACS in Odisha will continue under the PACS Computerisation Project, enhancing transparency and operational efficiency. Adoption of Model Bye-laws is being encouraged so that PACS can diversify into more than 25 economic activities such as PMKSKs, CSCs and PMBJKs. Significant financial support has been extended for infrastructure development, including a total outlay of ₹2,925.39 crore for the computerisation of functional PACS. Under the Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure (AMI) Scheme, margin money requirements for PACS godowns have been reduced from 20% to 10%, subsidy rates have been increased from 25% to 33.33%, and an additional subsidy equal to one-third of the total admissible subsidy is provided for ancillary facilities such as internal roads and weighbridges. The Ministry has also facilitated the disbursal of ₹190 crore to Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) and ₹98 crore to Fish Farmer Producer Organisations (FFPOs) through National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC). The establishment of national multi-state cooperative institutions—NCOL, NCEL and BBSSL—will further support market access, branding, procurement and value-chain participation for primary producers and the establishment of the Tribhuvan Sahkari University (TSU) for professionalising cooperative leadership, are further strengthening the long-term financial stability and governance of cooperatives across the country, including Odisha. *** Annexure-I Last 5 Years Activity wise Disbursement in Odisha (Rs.in crore) S.

To ensure a stable and adequate supply of qualified and trained manpower, the “Tribhuvan” Sahkari University is mandated to create a pan-India network of cooperative institutions by opening new schools at the University campus and other States and affiliating existing cooperative institutes/colleges based on a set of criteria to maintain quality standards. Further, the National Cooperation Policy 2025, which was launched by the Ministry on 24th July 2025, also contains the plan of the Central Government to involve national/state-level cooperative societies and universities in shaping the cooperative industry, some of which have been reproduced as under: 3.3.2. Encourage sectoral national federations to develop a repository of success stories on prevailing best practices in the cooperative sector to promote the spirit of cooperation and their emulation. Promote strengthening the upper tiers of the cooperatives to take on larger responsibilities in supporting their primary members to become more competitive. Encourage the national-level federations/unions to play leading roles in revitalizing the cooperative sector by helping member cooperatives to develop and adopt best practices for transparency and good governance, and deepening the cooperative movement through cooperative advocacy, awareness and member education.

                17 DEC 2025 5:04PM by PIB Delhi As per the updated seismic zonation map of India, the entire Himalayan arc falls within the highest seismic risk category, Seismic Zone VI, reflecting its extremely high tectonic activity and vulnerability to strong earthquakes. Only a small portion of the Ladakh region in the north-eastern corner falls under Seismic Zone V, which is the second-highest seismic hazard category. In view of the high-risk seismic categorisation of the Himalayan region, the Government has undertaken several focused initiatives to strengthen earthquake monitoring, hazard assessment, and preparedness. These measures include the expansion and upgradation of the seismic monitoring network across Himalayas, the conduct of detailed regional seismic hazard assessments, enhancement of strong-motion instrumentation, and improvement of data acquisition systems to enable precise detection and analysis of seismic events. In addition, various scientific studies relating to site response, fault mapping, and regional source characterisation have been carried out to support disaster risk reduction efforts and facilitate informed planning and development in the Himalayan region. Seismic Microzonation studies conducted by NCS for selected cities, help to identify differential ground-shaking characteristics at the local level, thereby assisting in safe land-use planning, infrastructure design, and mitigation strategies. The National Centre for Seismology (NCS) is making steady and systematic progress toward establishing an operational Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) system in India. A real-time seismic network dedicated to EEW has been initiated across the Himalayan region, including the installation of 10 P-Alert instruments in the Himachal Himalayas for rapid ground-motion detection.

                17 DEC 2025 5:02PM by PIB Delhi The accuracy of the forecasting models used by IMD has improved significantly; however, it is not possible to forecast with 100% accuracy. The skill score for 24-hour (1 day) in advance detection of monsoonal heavy rainfall over the meteorological subdivisions is 85% in 2024. At present, the accuracy of IMD's heavy rainfall forecasts, measured as the percentage of correct warnings, is 85%, 73%, 67%, 63%, and 58% for lead times ranging from one to five days, respectively. Overall, forecast accuracy for heavy rainfall events across the country improved by about 40% in 2023–2024 compared to 2014. IMD issues heavy rainfall impact-based forecasting and risk-based early warnings considering the amount of heavy rainfall and the susceptibility of the area of occurrence of heavy rainfall. The warning is issued at the meteorological subdivision and district level, valid up to 7 and 5 days, respectively. There is also nowcasting every three hours, with validity of the next three hours for heavy rainfall. IMD's state-of-the-art forecasting system is fully operational in all the districts of the country. The high-resolution models and GIS systems cover all the districts of the country. Regarding the Doppler Weather Radar (DWR) Network, currently, 47 DWRs are in operation across India, with 87% of the total area of the country coming under radar coverage . In the coming years, DWRs will be installed as per the requirement to cover the remaining gap areas in the country, provide redundancy, and replacement of old radars in the DWR network under Mission Mausam of MoES. The Ministry is continuously working to strengthen observational capabilities and R&D infrastructure to achieve greater accuracy in weather forecasting. Further, the IMD has expanded its infrastructure for observations, data exchange, monitoring & analysis, forecasting, and warning services in the country, including vulnerable districts. To provide computational support for such high-resolution models and to enable them to run regularly in real-time, the computing facilities (Arunika and Arka) have also been substantially increased to integrate voluminous data and run mesoscale, regional, and global models at higher resolutions. Further, recently, a new Central Sector Scheme, ""Mission Mausam"", was launched by the MoES to make Bharat a ""weather-ready and climate-smart"" nation. Various steps have been taken to ensure effective dissemination of warnings to vulnerable populations. The recently launched Bharat Forecasting System (BharatFS) has been developed primarily to improve short- and medium-range weather predictions. Forecast improvement is a continuous process with augmentation of more observations and Numerical Weather Prediction Models. With further improvement in  the observational network consisting of traditional (surface, AWS/ARG/HWSR, and upper air stations-RS/RW, GPS Sonde, Pilot balloon, and wind profilers) and remote-sensing observing platforms (Satellites and Radars), the forecast accuracy is likely to improve further. All warnings originated by IMD pertaining to Monsoon are made available to SDMAs in near real time for further dissemination over SMS, Mobile App, Sachet Public Portal, GAGAN & NaVIC Satellite terminals, and RSS feed. There is no processing delay in the Sachet platform. Central Water Commission (CWC) developed the FloodWatch India mobile application during the 2023 monsoon season to provide real-time flood information, forecasts, and alerts to users across the country. The FloodWatch India App, developed and maintained by the CWC, provides near real-time information and presently disseminates flood forecasting information (water levels) for 200 flood forecasting stations across the country, near real-time water levels for an additional 500+flood monitoring stations, and live storage status of 150+major reservoirs, thereby enabling continuous situational awareness for various stakeholders. The application serves as a vital decision-support tool for Disaster Management Authorities at the Central, State, District, and Local levels, besides being accessible to the general public. Timely availability of river flow conditions, flood forecasts, and reservoir storage data strengthens preparedness, early warning, and coordinated response during flood situations. Since its launch, CWC has been continuously sensitizing and engaging stakeholders through various platforms such as workshops, trainings, review meetings, and conferences to promote wider adoption of the application. CWC takes immense steps and adopts various dissemination mechanisms to ensure maximum reach of the flood warnings produced, so that mitigation measures can be adopted by State Governments, State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), and the Public. The total number of downloads till date from the Android (Google Play Store) is 35.1k, while from the iOS (Apple App Store) is 2.58k. For wider outreach, the app is prominently displayed on the CWC's official website and showcased in national exhibitions, including the most recent World Trade Fair. The flood forecasts formulated by CWC are disseminated to all stakeholders through the Flood Forecasting Website, FloodWatch India 2.0 App, e-mail, WhatsApp, Facebook (CWCOfficial.FF), X (Twitter CWCOfficial_FF), and the 'CWC Flood Updates' YouTube channel. Yes. The IMD provides threshold-based, impact-based forecasts and risk-based early warnings, which are colour-coded, to all the districts of the country. A suitable colour code is used to highlight the impact of the severe weather expected and signal disaster management about the course of action to be taken regarding an impending severe weather event. IMD's Impact-Based Forecasting (IBF) provides localized risk assessments for vulnerable populations in advance of extreme events. CWC monitors the floods in three categories with assigned colors, namely Above Normal-Yellow(River water level between Warning level & Danger level), Severe-Orange(River water level between danger level & Highest Flood Level), and Extreme-Red (River Water Level above Highest Flood Level). As per the Ministry of Home Affairs Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), Above Normal flood situation is updated on daily basis, Severe Flood is updated on 6 hourly basis and Extreme Flood is updated on 3 hourly basis. Sachet is disseminating alerts, which are colour-coded. SDMAs are converting the forecast/warnings received from five Warnings & Forecast generating Agencies (AGAs)- India Meteorological Department (IMD), Central Water Commission (CWC), Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), Defence Geoinformatics Research Establishment (DGRE), and Forest Survey of India (FSI) into impact-based alerts before dissemination on the Sachet platform. Yes, since inception, Sachet disseminates alerts to all States & UTs, and till now approximately 89 thousand alerts have been generated on the SACHET Platform, and 11000 Crore SMSs have been sent to the citizens. At present, there are nearly 13.98 lakh Mobile App Users and 31.57 thousand Browser Notification users in the country. NDMA regularly undertakes targeted campaigns to inform, educate, and raise public awareness about various hazards and disaster management initiatives, including the SACHET App/Portal. Awareness about the SACHET App/Portal is being disseminated consistently through electronic and print media, specialized field-based outreach activities such as awareness van campaigns, Nukkad Natak, focused social media campaigns, proactive sharing of the QR code across digital and print events, including Maha Kumbh 2025 and the India International Trade Fair (IITF). ***** NKR/AK (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205323) आगंतुक पटल  : 8 Ministry of Earth Sciences PARLIAMENT QUESTION: MONSOON WARNING SYSTEM प्रविष्टि तिथि:

For wider outreach, the app is prominently displayed on the CWC's official website and showcased in national exhibitions, including the most recent World Trade Fair. The flood forecasts formulated by CWC are disseminated to all stakeholders through the Flood Forecasting Website, FloodWatch India 2.0 App, e-mail, WhatsApp, Facebook (CWCOfficial.FF), X (Twitter CWCOfficial_FF), and the 'CWC Flood Updates' YouTube channel. Yes. The IMD provides threshold-based, impact-based forecasts and risk-based early warnings, which are colour-coded, to all the districts of the country. A suitable colour code is used to highlight the impact of the severe weather expected and signal disaster management about the course of action to be taken regarding an impending severe weather event. IMD's Impact-Based Forecasting (IBF) provides localized risk assessments for vulnerable populations in advance of extreme events. CWC monitors the floods in three categories with assigned colors, namely Above Normal-Yellow(River water level between Warning level & Danger level), Severe-Orange(River water level between danger level & Highest Flood Level), and Extreme-Red (River Water Level above Highest Flood Level). As per the Ministry of Home Affairs Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), Above Normal flood situation is updated on daily basis, Severe Flood is updated on 6 hourly basis and Extreme Flood is updated on 3 hourly basis. Sachet is disseminating alerts, which are colour-coded. SDMAs are converting the forecast/warnings received from five Warnings & Forecast generating Agencies (AGAs)- India Meteorological Department (IMD), Central Water Commission (CWC), Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), Defence Geoinformatics Research Establishment (DGRE), and Forest Survey of India (FSI) into impact-based alerts before dissemination on the Sachet platform. Yes, since inception, Sachet disseminates alerts to all States & UTs, and till now approximately 89 thousand alerts have been generated on the SACHET Platform, and 11000 Crore SMSs have been sent to the citizens. At present, there are nearly 13.98 lakh Mobile App Users and 31.57 thousand Browser Notification users in the country. NDMA regularly undertakes targeted campaigns to inform, educate, and raise public awareness about various hazards and disaster management initiatives, including the SACHET App/Portal. Awareness about the SACHET App/Portal is being disseminated consistently through electronic and print media, specialized field-based outreach activities such as awareness van campaigns, Nukkad Natak, focused social media campaigns, proactive sharing of the QR code across digital and print events, including Maha Kumbh 2025 and the India International Trade Fair (IITF). ***** NKR/AK (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205323)","2025-12-17T11:51:16.732215"

                17 DEC 2025 5:00PM by PIB Delhi The current forecasting models used by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) are highly accurate. In 2024, the skill score for 24-hour (one-day) advance detection of heavy rainfall over meteorological subdivisions stands at 85%. At present, the accuracy of IMD's heavy rainfall forecasts, measured as the percentage of correct warnings, is 85%, 73%, 67%, 63% and 58% for lead times ranging from one to five days, respectively. Overall, forecast accuracy for heavy rainfall events across the country improved by about 40% in 2023–2024 compared to 2014. The Geological Survey of India (GSI), under the Ministry of Mines, has been mandated to issue regional landslide forecasts/early warnings based on rainfall thresholds. Currently, GSI issues operational/experimental daily regional landslide forecast bulletins to 21 districts in 08 (eight) States during the monsoon period. GSI's landslide forecast model is primarily based on rainfall thresholds derived from historical rainfall and landslide occurrence data, in conjunction with daily rainfall forecast data received from institutions under the Ministry of Earth Sciences. Regarding the efficiency of this current forecast model, the evaluation shows a hit rate of more than 80% across the forecasting zones of operational districts, viz, Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Nilgiris and Rudraprayag. Improving the accuracy of weather forecasts requires enhanced state-of-the-art observational networks, skilled human resources to undertake research and development for the development of numerical weather prediction models, and robust infrastructure, such as high-performance computing systems to run these models at the required high resolution to predict weather patterns caused by climate change. The Ministry is in continuous endeavour of augmenting the observational and R&D infrastructure towards achieving better accuracy in weather forecasting. The major new initiative undertaken by the Government is the implementation of the Mission Mausam. A couple of Doppler Weather Radars (DWRs) have already been installed under the mission. Currently, 47 radars are in operation across India, with 87% of the country's total area under radar coverage. Under the Mission Mausam, the Bharat Forecast System (BharatFS), an advanced weather forecasting model, has been developed and is operational at a high spatial resolution of 6-km. It also has the capability to provide predictions of rainfall events up to 10 days, covering the short and medium-range forecasts. Due to its higher resolution and improved dynamics, it generates weather forecasts at the panchayat or cluster of panchayats level. Further, a major achievement is the introduction of the Mithuna Forecast System (Mithuna-FS). This new-generation global coupled model integrates the atmosphere, ocean, land surface, and sea ice components with state-of-the-art physics and an upgraded data assimilation framework. Currently, this forecasting system operates at 12-km resolution, marking a significant advancement in India's medium-range localized weather forecasting capability. The Mithuna-FS suite also includes – A 4-km high-resolution regional model for accurate simulation of monsoon dynamics, cyclones, and mesoscale extreme events over the Indian subcontinent; A 330-m hyper-resolution urban model for fog, visibility, and air-quality forecasting over the Delhi region. IMD consistently issues timely alerts and forecasts to the public and concerned stakeholders. Various steps have been taken to ensure effective dissemination of warnings to vulnerable populations. IMD's weather information, including alerts  and warnings to the public, is provided through various platforms: Mass Media: Radio/TV, Newspaper network (AM, FM, Community Radio, Private TV), Prasar Bharati, and private broadcasters.

Moreover, IMD developed a mobile App, 'MAUSAM' for weather forecasting, 'Meghdoot' for Agromet advisory dissemination, and 'Damini' for lightning alerts. The Common Alert Protocol (CAP), developed by the NDMA, is also being implemented to disseminate warnings by the IMD. IMD currently is equipped with a Decision Support System (DSS) based real-time multi-hazard impact based early warning system (EWS), which integrates all types of real-time and historical data, numerical weather prediction products, etc., to effectively monitor, detect and provide timely forecasts and impact-based warnings with suggested actions up to districts and city/station levels against all types of extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall events, droughts etc. IMD has Meteorological Centres (MCs) in each State and also special centers like Cyclone Warning Centers available for each impacted State, which provide services during cyclones and heavy rainfall seasons round the clock, respectively. As a result of these new initiatives, the overall skill of forecasting these severe weather events has been improved by 30-40% over the last 10 years. ***** NKR/AK (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205318) आगंतुक पटल  : 8 Ministry of Earth Sciences PARLIAMENT QUESTION: FORECASTING OF HEAVY RAINS AND LANDSLIDES प्रविष्टि तिथि:

                17 DEC 2025 4:58PM by PIB Delhi The Government has taken due note of the climate change across the country. The Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), Government of India, through its Climate Change report titled ""Assessment of Climate Change over the Indian Region (https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-15-4327-2)"" has assessed the impact of climate change across the country. Since the middle of the twentieth century, India has witnessed a rise in average temperature; a decrease in monsoon precipitation; a rise in extreme temperature and rainfall events, droughts, and a rise in sea levels; and an increase in the intensity of severe cyclones. The soil degradation and groundwater depletion is emerging as one of the most serious environmental and socio-economic challenges. The Government has undertaken multiple initiatives to advance Earth science research, capacity building, and educational infrastructure across the country. Dedicated institutes under the MoES e.g., Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), India Meteorological Department (IMD), National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF), Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR), National Centre for Seismology (NCS), National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR), National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), Centre for Marine Living Resources & Ecology (CMLRE), National Center for Earth System Sciences (NCESS) are advancing research in the interactions between the atmosphere, oceans, and polar systems, focusing on their role in regional climate dynamics and extreme weather patterns. IITM lead the flagship capacity‑building initiative under MoES, the Development of Skilled Manpower in Earth System Sciences (DESK) program, with the objective to develop academic habit through training on targeted areas and semester-based coursework in Earth Sciences. Efforts are also being made to strengthen the scientific community's capacity in climate science and assessment through training programs, workshops, and knowledge exchanges, ensuring that India has the necessary expertise to understand and respond to the complex climate challenges. The Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) has developed advanced early warning systems for severe weather events such as cyclones, heavy rainfall, droughts, and other extreme conditions. Early warning for severe weather events is supported by a state-of-the-art observation network that includes surface, upper air, remote sensing observations, seamless forecasting systems based on high-resolution dynamical models, and GIS-based tools for generating alerts and warnings. The entire system is integrated with modern telecommunication technologies to ensure the timely and effective dissemination of information. Recently, the India Meteorological Department (IMD), in coordination with other centres in the MoES, has developed an end-to-end GIS-based Decision Support System (DSS), which has been working as the front end of the early warning systems for the timely detection and monitoring of all-weather hazards across the country, including the States regularly affected by cyclones and other natural disasters. It is supported with specific severe weather modules to provide timely impact-based early warnings for extreme weather events like cyclones, heavy rainfall, droughts, etc., which devastate human lives, livelihoods, and infrastructure. The system utilizes historical data, including extreme events, as well as real-time surface and upper-air meteorological observations available for the Indian region and its neighbouring areas. It also includes RADAR observations, available every 10 minutes, and satellite products every 15 minutes. It also uses numerical weather prediction products from a suite of models run in the MoES institutions. These include hyperlocal, regional, and global models. Further, IMD plays a crucial role in safeguarding lives and property through its advanced observational network and forecasting systems, enabling timely preparedness and response in close collaboration with the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). This coordinated approach ensures that accurate and timely weather information reaches authorities and the public, enhancing disaster risk reduction efforts across the country. The Central Water Commission (CWC) is mandated to issue short-range flood forecasts with a lead time of up to 24 hours to concerned State Governments at identified locations. Timely flood forecasts are being issued when a certain threshold limit is reached. The CWC has taken several steps by adopting various dissemination mechanisms to get maximum reach to the flood warnings, so that mitigation measures can be adopted by State Governments, SDMA, NDMA, and the public. Further, w ith an aim of disseminating information related to the flood situation in the country and flood forecasts up to 7 days on a real-time basis to the public through mobile phones, version 2.0 of the 'FloodWatch India' mobile application has been developed by the CWC, which provides current information on flood conditions across the country. Further, it also provides additional information regarding the storage positions of 150 major reservoirs in the country, which helps in a better understanding of the possible flood situation in their downstream areas. The 'FloodWatch India' app is available for download. The Geological Survey of India (GSI) is mandated to conduct landslide studies in landslide-prone areas in the country. In July 2024, with the inauguration of the National Landslide Forecasting Centre (NLFC) at Kolkata, GSI achieved a milestone by operationalizing landslide forecasting in three districts in two States, viz. Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts of West Bengal and the Nilgiris district of Tamil Nadu. At present, RLFS covers 21 districts (04 operational and 17 experimental) in eight states (West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Nagaland, Karnataka, and Kerala). These bulletins forecast information on the possibility of occurrence of landslides up to the taluk / sub-divisional level daily for the next 48 hours. IMD has adopted new techniques and technology from time to time to detect, monitor, and provide timely early warnings for the entire country, including the States regularly affected by all types of extreme weather events like cyclones , heavy rainfall, droughts, etc., which have devastating impacts on human lives, livelihoods, and infrastructure. There has been significant progress in this direction with: Strengthening of the observing system with installation of additional AWS, ARG, and DWR, etc. Improvement of the data integration and development of GIS-based DSS. Improvement of NWP models and climate models, as well as a real-time seamless monitoring, forecasting, and early warning system. Shifting from conventional weather forecast and warning to sector-specific color-coded Impact-based forecast (IBF) and risk-based warning (RBW) up to district/sub-city levels with dynamical impact and risk matrix. Application of AI/ML. Customisation of bulletins and warnings. Substantial increase of computational power to integrate voluminous data and to run meso-scale, regional, and global models at a further higher resolution scale with improvement of process understanding and model physics. Supercomputers (Arka and Arunika) are being used for this purpose. Panchayat Mausam Seva. A state-of-the-art dissemination system with the use of a mobile app, Common Alerting Protocol (CAP), WhatsApp groups, etc. IMD developed a mobile App, 'MAUSAM' for weather forecasting, 'Meghdoot' for Agromet advisory dissemination, and 'Damini' for lightning alerts. IMD has also brought out a web-based online ""Climate Hazard & Vulnerability Atlas of India"" prepared for the thirteen most hazardous meteorological events, which cause extensive damage and economic, human, and animal losses. The same can be accessed at https://imdpune.gov.in/hazardatlas/abouthazard.html. This atlas will help State Government authorities and disaster management agencies identify the hotspots and plan and take appropriate action to tackle extreme weather events. This product helps build Climate Change resilient infrastructure. The Government of India has recently launched Mission Mausam, a national initiative, under the Ministry of Earth Sciences with a goal of making Bharat a ""Weather-ready and Climate-smart"" nation to mitigate the impact of climate change and extreme weather events and strengthen the resilience of communities. Under Mission Mausam, initiatives are undergoing to develop a hybrid Earth System Modeling framework (dynamical model with AI based parameterisation) for weather predictions and  climate projections. In addition, India has augmented its HPC power by commissioning state-of-the-art High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems 'Arka' (at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune) and 'Arunika' (at the National Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting, Noida) for Earth System Modeling. Enhancing the HPC facilities and Earth System Modeling capabilities are planned under Mission Mausam. Various initiatives were undertaken to foster enhanced collaboration among national research institutions within India. Major national missions, such as the Mission Mausam, Monsoon Mission, and Deep Ocean Mission, are designed to enhance collaboration across various national institutes like IITM, IMD, ISRO, NCMRWF, INCOIS, NIOT, and national research institutions and universities. Joint research initiatives integrate satellite data from ISRO with forecasting systems of IMD and research inputs from academic institutions. India is actively collaborating with international programs like the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), the World Weather Research Program, etc., on weather and climate research and to develop and improve weather and climate models. These models aim to simulate and predict the interactions between the atmosphere, ocean, and polar regions, crucial for understanding regional extremes and climate impacts. These collective actions contribute to a more robust understanding of Earth System interactions, which is essential for enhancing India's resilience to extreme weather and climate change impacts. ***** NKR/AK (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205313) आगंतुक पटल  : 9 Ministry of Earth Sciences PARLIAMENT QUESTION: RISING THREATS OF CLIMATE CHANGE प्रविष्टि तिथि:

The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) was mandated by the UNGA in 2001 to harness the potential of knowledge and technology to support development for all and to ensure that their benefits reach all people and countries. The WSIS process was conducted in two phases- Geneva (2003) and Tunis (2005). Later the progress in implementing WSIS outcomes reviewed by UNGA during the WSIS +10 Review Process in 2015. The WSIS+20 Review in 2025, conducts a comprehensive review by taking stock of the achievements, key trends, progress and challenges over two decades since the inception of WSIS and outlines priority areas for focus. Speaking on the occasion, Shri Prasada conveyed  that over the past two decades, WSIS has demonstrated how digital technologies, when guided by shared values, can advance development, inclusion and human dignity. He further recalled Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s emphasis that “ global challenges demand that global action must match global ambition ”. Delivering the statement, Shri Prasada highlighted that India’s digital transformation has been a lived experience at population scale, driven by Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) built as a public good - open, interoperable, secure and affordable by design. He added that platforms enabling digital identity, instant payments, digital documentation, telemedicine, online education and grievance redressal today serve people across diverse geographies, languages and income levels, ensuring that technology empowers the last mile and the last person. Shri Prasada further recalled India’s launch of the Global Digital Public Infrastructure Repository during its G20 Presidency, reflecting the principle that digital public goods can act as an equaliser rather than a divider. He reaffirmed India’s commitment to sharing capacity, tools and knowledge with partner countries, guided by the ethos of “One Earth, One Family, One Future.” On emerging technologies, Shri Prasada noted that Artificial Intelligence is central to the next phase of sustainable development. Through the IndiaAI Mission, India is investing in responsible AI ecosystems, expanding national compute capacity, creating repositories of reusable datasets through AI Kosh, and building Bhashini, an AI and NLP-enabled real-time translation tool, to make the content available in various languages spoken in our country. He added that India has also proposed the creation of a Global Repository of AI Applications to accelerate AI for social good. Emphasising the importance of resilient semiconductor and electronics supply chains being foundational to digital transformation and AI at scale, Shri Prasada outlined the ongoing efforts made to strengthen domestic capabilities while deepening international partnerships to enhance global technology resilience. Reaffirming strong support for the multistakeholder model of Internet governance, except in matters of national security, Shri Prasada stressed the importance of strengthening the Internet Governance Forum, advancing Universal Acceptance and Multilingual Access, promoting Open Standards, prioritizing DNS stability, and ensuring meaningful participation of the Global South. Highlighting trust as the bedrock of the digital future, the Union Minister of State also emphasised the need to balance innovation with safety, privacy, human rights and sustainability. He also invited all Member States to the IndiaAI Impact Summit in February 2026, guided by the principle “Sarvajan Hitay, Sarvajan Sukhay”—Welfare of All, Happiness for All. Concluding his statement, Shri Prasad also appreciated the stewardship of Mr. Ekitela Lokaale, Permanent Representative of Kenya, and Ms. Suela Janina, Permanent Representative of Albania, in facilitating the WSIS+20 outcome document. He added that WSIS+20 offers a defining opportunity to ensure that digital progress bridges divides, empowers societies and reinforces human dignity, and reaffirmed India’s readiness to work with all nations to build an inclusive digital future where no one is left behind. *** MSZ (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205220) आगंतुक पटल  : 64 Ministry of Electronics & IT Shri Jitin Prasada, Union Minister of State delivers the national statement at the High-level Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on the overall review of the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS+20) in New York प्रविष्टि तिथि:

                17 DEC 2025 3:57PM by PIB Delhi Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Bhupender Yadav today chaired a high-level meeting to undertake a detailed review of the Action Plans of the Municipal Bodies of Delhi and Sonipat, for tackling air pollution in Delhi-NCR cities. This was the third meeting in the ongoing series of structured reviews, conducted on prescribed parameters and formats as directed by the Minister in the earlier meeting held on 03.12.2025. The Minister directed officers to remain closely connected with ground-level realities, identify the major sources of pollution in the NCR, and evolve practical and implementable solutions. Stressing the need to improve the global image of the National Capital, Shri Yadav underscored the importance of a ‘Whole-of-Government’ and ‘Whole-of-Society’ approach to effectively address air pollution. Issuing specific directions, the Minister stated that Construction and Demolition (C&D) activities must not be permitted unless C&D waste handling and processing infrastructure is identified and created within a 10 km radius of the construction site. He further directed that provisions be made to prohibit demolition during the peak pollution period in the NCR from October to December, with immediate directions to be issued pending amendments in the rules. Inspection drives were ordered to be launched forthwith across NCR cities, with strict action against defaulters. Emphasising that challans should not be an end in itself, the Minister called for a practical approach, focusing on targeting major polluters rather than inconveniencing the common public. “Motivate stakeholders, persuade the public, and act firmly against defaulters,” he said. Shri Yadav also directed that proper placement of multi-level parking facilities in Delhi be ensured so that they do not themselves become sources of traffic congestion. He instructed the removal of illegal parkings and encroachments from 62 identified traffic congestion hotspots in the city. A detailed plan is to be prepared to identify road corridors and enable signal-free movement during peak traffic hours from 9–11 am and 4–7 pm, in coordination with Delhi Police. Vehicles below BS-IV standards are not to be allowed on these corridors. The Minister stressed that unplanned urban expansion must be checked and called for last-mile connectivity for residents of high-rise buildings to nearby public transport hubs to increase use of public transport facilities and reduce peak-hour congestion. He also directed exploration of the expansion of waste-to-energy plants at Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) dump sites and identification of open spaces for greening through public participation, including adoption of parks and water bodies. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi was asked to adopt a 360-degree approach encompassing legislative reforms, enforcement action, and provision of alternative solutions to people living or working in encroachments . These measures are to be on the lines of voluntary relocation models followed in tiger reserves, with the objective of eliminating traffic congestion and pollution hotspots. The Minister further directed fast-tracking the liquidation of Okhla, Bhalswa and Ghazipur legacy waste dump sites to achieve tangible results by the end of 2026. Removal of stray animals from roads was also emphasised to prevent accidents and traffic jams. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) was requested to analyse PNG production and consumption bills of industrial units to assess the actual transition of polluting units to clean fuel. The Minister stressed the need for sustained awareness programmes to bring about behavioural change among all stakeholder groups and encouraged voluntary public participation. IEC activities were directed to focus on actual pollution stakeholders such as industries and construction companies, making them aware of applicable by-laws and parameters. CAQM was asked to revise IEC guidelines accordingly. Shri Yadav also called for provision of heating devices to workers through CSR initiatives to prevent biomass and MSW burning in the NCR. Emphasising handholding and supportive facilities to enable behavioural change , the Minister called upon citizens to become active partners in the fight against air pollution and urged all agencies to work in mission mode to achieve a 40 per cent reduction in AQI over the next one year. The meeting was attended by the Secretary (MoEFCC), Chairman, Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), senior officers of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), Secretary (Environment & Forest), GNCTD, and Municipal Commissioners of Delhi and Sonipat. ***** VM (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205235) आगंतुक पटल  : 102 Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Union Environment Minister Chairs High-Level Review on Air Pollution Mitigation Action Plans of Delhi and Sonipat, the Third in Series of Review Meetings for Delhi-NCR Shri Bhupender Yadav calls for a Practical Approach in identifying Sources of Pollution and evolving Implementable Solutions, Targeting Major Polluters rather than Inconveniencing the Common Public Remove Encroachments, Liquidate Legacy Waste Dump Sites; Improve Last-mile Public Transport Connectivity, Identify Road Corridors for Signal-Free Movement during Peak Traffic Hours in Delhi: Shri Yadav प्रविष्टि तिथि:

                17 DEC 2025 4:50PM by PIB Delhi and (b) As informed by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), the CSIR–Central Food Technological Research Institute (CSIR–CFTRI), Mysuru–a constituent laboratory of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) had undertaken four Grant-in-Aid projects related to the study and development of annatto. Out of the four projects three were funded by Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) and one by Department of Biotechnology (DBT).  The institute is also participating in the CSIR Mission Mode project titled “Bioresource Conservation & Prospection (CSIR-BioCap)” which envisages the development of Vitamin-E enriched annatto oil for use in food and cosmetic applications, among others. CSIR–CFTRI has developed and successfully demonstrated following post-harvest technologies related to annatto: Annatto Dye Preparation – The developed process involves the batch type percolation technique using counter current extraction of annatto seeds with selective solvents and further solvent recovery and vacuum dehydration of concentrated dye to crystal like form. The crystal-like dye can be further used in the formulations in the form of water soluble, oil soluble and refined powder. Annatto Seed Separator - A small, continuous power operated machine was designed and developed for the separation of annatto seeds from pods. The machine was conceived as a low-cost, easy-to-dismantle and easy-to-fabricate device for removing the seed from the annatto pod with the machine capacity of 100 kg/hr having seed output of 40 kg/hr . In addition to the above, CSIR–CFTRI has undertaken studies by visiting relevant industries and by engaging experts in various commercial and traditional food sectors to explore the application of different annatto-based formulations such as oil-soluble, water-soluble, propylene glycol (PG)-based, sugar-based and acid-soluble colorants. Colour concentrations for these formulations were standardized to obtain the required shades across different food sectors, and the dye concentration and suitability were evaluated for a variety of commercial and traditional food products. Tailor-made formulations based on water-soluble carbonate systems were found suitable for use in hard-boiled candies, vermicelli, gold fingers, and fast foods such as biriyani and vegetable manchurian. Similarly, PG-based tailor-made formulations were found suitable for traditional sweetmeats such as boondi laddu and motichoor laddu, as well as dairy and bakery products including butter, cheese, biscuit cream, bakery cream, and icing cream. The sugar-powder formulation was found convenient for application in hard-boiled candies, jalebi, jangri, and boondi laddu. As, informed by the Tamil Nadu Agriculture University, Annatto is a moderately drought tolerant and requires less water. Planting is done during the monsoon season (June to September). Forest college and Research Institute (FC & RI), Mettupalayam has developed precision silvicultural practices and canopy management practices for maximizing seed yield in Annatto.

                17 DEC 2025 4:47PM by PIB Delhi As per 20 th Livestock Census, 2019, country has 193.46 million cattle population and out of this 142.11 million are indigenous and nondescript cattle, which is 73.45% of the total cattle population in the country. In order to supplement the efforts made by the States and Union Territories, to conserve, promote and increase the population of  indigenous bovine breeds, Government of India is implementing Rashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM) for development and conservation of indigenous breeds, genetic upgradation of bovine population and enhancement of milk production and productivity of bovines. All indigenous bovine breeds as recognised by National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources are covered under the scheme. Following steps are being taken under the scheme: (i) Implementation of Nationwide Artificial Insemination Programme (NAIP) using semen of high merit bulls including bulls of indigenous breeds. Under the component Artificial Insemination (AI) services is delivered free of cost at farmers’ doorstep in the districts with less than 50% AI coverage. During the last 3 years 5.12 crore animals covered, 8.99 crore AI performed and 2.85 crore farmers benefitted. The details of beneficiaries benefitted during the last three years state wise is given at Annexure-I. (ii)        The Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Government of India has established sex sorted semen production facilities and implementing Accelerated Breed Improvement Programme using sex sorted semen with the aim to produce female calves up to 90% accuracy thereby enhancing milch cattle population, breed improvement and farmers' income. Government has launched indigenously developed sex sorted semen technology to deliver sex sorted semen at reasonable rates to farmers including sex sorted semen of indigenous breeds. (iii) Implementation of progeny testing and pedigree selection for production of high genetic merit bulls including bulls of indigenous breeds like Gir, Sahiwal, Tharparkar, Kankrej, Hariana, Rathi, Gaolao breeds of cattle and Murrah, Mehsana, Jaffarabadi, Pandharpuri, Nili Ravi, Banni breeds of buffalo. High genetic merit bulls of indigenous breeds produced under the programme are being made available to semen stations for semen production. (iv) Implementation of In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Technology: To propagate elite animals of indigenous breeds, the Department has established 24 IVF laboratories. The technology has important role in genetic upgradation of bovine population in single generation. Further, to deliver technology at reasonable rates to farmers Government has launched indigenous IVF media.

                        17 DEC 2025 4:47PM by PIB Delhi As per 20 th Livestock Census, 2019, country has 193.46 million cattle population and out of this 142.11 million are indigenous and nondescript cattle, which is 73.45% of the total cattle population in the country. In order to supplement the efforts made by the States and Union Territories, to conserve, promote and increase the population of  indigenous bovine breeds, Government of India is implementing Rashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM) for development and conservation of indigenous breeds, genetic upgradation of bovine population and enhancement of milk production and productivity of bovines. All indigenous bovine breeds as recognised by National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources are covered under the scheme. Following steps are being taken under the scheme: (i) Implementation of Nationwide Artificial Insemination Programme (NAIP) using semen of high merit bulls including bulls of indigenous breeds. Under the component Artificial Insemination (AI) services is delivered free of cost at farmers’ doorstep in the districts with less than 50% AI coverage. During the last 3 years 5.12 crore animals covered, 8.99 crore AI performed and 2.85 crore farmers benefitted. The details of beneficiaries benefitted during the last three years state wise is given at Annexure-I. (ii)        The Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Government of India has established sex sorted semen production facilities and implementing Accelerated Breed Improvement Programme using sex sorted semen with the aim to produce female calves up to 90% accuracy thereby enhancing milch cattle population, breed improvement and farmers' income. Government has launched indigenously developed sex sorted semen technology to deliver sex sorted semen at reasonable rates to farmers including sex sorted semen of indigenous breeds. (iii) Implementation of progeny testing and pedigree selection for production of high genetic merit bulls including bulls of indigenous breeds like Gir, Sahiwal, Tharparkar, Kankrej, Hariana, Rathi, Gaolao breeds of cattle and Murrah, Mehsana, Jaffarabadi, Pandharpuri, Nili Ravi, Banni breeds of buffalo. High genetic merit bulls of indigenous breeds produced under the programme are being made available to semen stations for semen production. (iv) Implementation of In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Technology: To propagate elite animals of indigenous breeds, the Department has established 24 IVF laboratories. The technology has important role in genetic upgradation of bovine population in single generation. Further, to deliver technology at reasonable rates to farmers Government has launched indigenous IVF media. Genomic Selection:  To select High Genetic Merit (HGM) animals and to accelerate genetic improvement of cattle and buffaloes, the Department has developed unified genomic chips—Gau Chip for indigenous cattle and Mahish Chip for indigenous buffaloes—specifically designed for initiating genomic selection of high genetic merit animals in the country.

                17 DEC 2025 12:17PM by PIB Delhi India’s fisheries sector has undergone a remarkable transformation over the past seven decades, shifting from a predominantly marine-based activity to an inland and aquaculture-driven powerhouse. Total fish production surged from 7.52 lakh tonnes in 1950–51 to an estimated 197.75 lakh tonnes in 2024–25 (provisional) recording a 26-fold increase. Over the last decade, the Government of India has significantly scaled up investments in the sector, channeling Rs 39,272 crore through major initiatives such as the Blue Revolution Scheme, FIDF, Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana, and PM Matsya Kisan Samridhi Sah-Yojana (PMMKSSY). These interventions have propelled fish production from 95.79 lakh tonnes in 2013–14 to 197.75 lakh tonnes in 2024–25 (provisional), an impressive growth of over 100%. Shrimp production, India’s flagship aquaculture commodity, expanded by 267%, rising from 3.22 lakh tonnes (2013–14) to a record 11.84 lakh tonnes (2023–24). India’s seafood exports have more than doubled during the same period, increasing from Rs 30,213 crore in 2013–14 to Rs 62,408 crore in 2024–25, marking a 111.73% rise despite pandemic disruptions and persistent non-tariff barriers in global markets. The fisheries sector is a vital pillar of India’s economy and social fabric, supporting nearly three crore fishers and fish farmers and several lakh workers across the value chain. As an affordable, nutrient-rich source of animal protein, fish significantly contributes to national food and nutritional security. India’s rapid growth in fish production and exports has been driven by technological innovation, strong institutional support, and proactive policy measures. Under the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY), the Department of Fisheries has modernized infrastructure and introduced advanced technologies through interventions such as genetic improvement of key species; establishment of brood banks, brood stock multiplication centres, hatcheries, and seed-rearing units; construction of diverse grow-out ponds; development of raceways and reservoir cage culture; promotion of RAS and biofloc systems; expansion of sea cages; species diversification; and modernization of the fishing fleet. To further accelerate growth, 34 Production and Processing Clusters have been notified across States and Union Territories to enhance production, productivity, and value addition. India’s marine fisheries have long been anchored in sustainability, guided by the National Policy on Marine Fisheries, 2017, which promotes an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management. Government schemes have consistently advanced sustainable practices, with a strong focus on expanding deep-sea fishing and enabling traditional fishers to access distant areas of the EEZ. Under PMMSY, support has been extended for 480 deep-sea fishing vessels and the upgradation of 1,338 vessels for traditional fishermen. A recent, major milestone in this regard is the notification of the Sustainable Harnessing of Fisheries in the EEZ Rules, 2025, empowering traditional and small-scale fishers, cooperatives, and FFPOs to tap untapped offshore resources, enhance processing and export opportunities, and strengthen national self-reliance in deep-sea fisheries. Science-based measures such as fishing bans during spawning seasons, minimum legal sizes, bycatch reduction, improved onboard handling, sea ranching, artificial reefs development, and protection of Essential Fish Habitats such as spawning and feeding grounds are taken for ensuring sustainability of the marine fisheries. Mariculture is being promoted alongside capture fisheries through the schemes and policies. The Department on 21 November 2025 brought out the Standard Operating Procedure for Mariculture (2025) to foster responsible, inclusive coastal development. To build climate resilience, PMMSY is developing 100 Climate Resilient Coastal Fishermen Villages, making coastal villages more resilient and economically vibrant. The Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying signed a Technical Cooperation Programme (TCP) with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in March 2025 for “Strengthening of Blue Ports in India,” fully funded by FAO with an allocation of USD 100,000. The TCP supports two pilot Smart and Integrated Fishing Harbour projects at Vanakbara (Diu) and Jakhau (Gujarat), aimed at modernizing fishing infrastructure with a strong focus on environmental sustainability, operational efficiency, and safety. By integrating smart technologies, these harbours are expected to streamline operations, enhance safety standards, and promote eco‑friendly practices. In addition, the Department of Fisheries, in collaboration with FAO and the Government of Andhra Pradesh, is implementing a Global Environment Facility (GEF‑8) project titled “Transforming Andhra Pradesh Aquaculture to a Sustainable, Reduced Footprint and Climate‑Resilient Food System.” The initiative focuses on advancing sustainable aquaculture in the State. The GEF Secretariat has approved the project with a grant of USD 13,155,657 (approximately Rs 18 crore), marking a significant step toward climate‑resilient and environmentally responsible aquaculture development. Under PMMSY, the Department of Fisheries has approved Andhra Pradesh’s proposals for 39 activities at a total cost of Rs 2,398.72 crore, with a central share of Rs 559.10 crore, of which Rs 482.55 crore has been released during 2020–21 to 2024–25. For Telangana, proposals amounting to Rs 347.20 crore have been approved, with a central share of Rs 109.92 crore and Rs 85.54 crore released for fisheries and aquaculture development.

                17 DEC 2025 11:59AM by PIB Delhi (a):       The post-harvest infrastructure such as ice plants, cold storages and fish kiosks have been implemented in association with State Governments, Union Territories (UTs) under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme Component of Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY). The Central fund for implementation of such post harvest infrastructure projects is provided to concerned State Governments and UTs under PMMSY. The post-harvest infrastructure facilities developed under PMMSY and earlier schemes have been contributing in fish preservation, maintaining of fish quality, increase of shelf life of fish & fisheries products for higher price realization to fishers, fish farmers and other associated stakeholders. The recent study title “Assessment of Post Harvest Losses in Inland and Marine Fisheries” conducted through the National Productivity Council (NPC) revealed that the national average of post-harvest losses in inland fisheries has been reduced from 18% (FY 2019-20) to 8.84% (FY 2023-24) and in marine fisheries it is reduced from 21% (FY 2019-20) to 9.3% (FY 2023-24). This study further reported the average national post harvest losses in fisheries sector at 9.16% during 2023-24. (b):       The high resolution, geo-tagged household and infrastructure-level granular digital data collected under the National Marine Fisheries Census facilitate targeted delivery of schemes, identification of vulnerable groups, assessment of infrastructure gaps (harbours, markets, cold chains) and support climate-resilient livelihood-based interventions & evidence-based planning. Further, the geo-referenced digital database is anticipated to strengthen the  policy planning for fisheries sector, supports evidence-based infrastructure investments, enhance livelihood initiatives by identifying training needs and improving scheme access to fishing communities. This also facilitate better monitoring of sustainability parameters, shift to digital workflows improves efficiency, accuracy, and transparency in operations. (c) and (d):      The Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying recognizing the importance of developing the coastal communities, has taken up a transformative initiative under the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) to develop the existing 100 Coastal Fishermen Villages(CFV) situated close to the coastline in all Coastal States and Union Territories(UTs) as Climate Resilient Coastal Fishermen Villages(CRCFV) and to make them as economically vibrant fishermen villages. This programme with 100% central funding is implemented through the National Fisheries Development Board. It is reported that proposals of various coastal State Government and Union Territories for development of 95 existing coastal villages as Climate Resilient Coastal Fishermen Villages (CRCFVs) at a total cost of Rs.190 crore have been approved and central funds to a tune of Rs.47.50 crore to the State Governments/UTs. The Climate Resilient Coastal Fishermen Villages programme inter-alia envisages development of various climate resilient livelihood activities like open sea cage culture, seaweed and bivalve cultivation to create and sustain the alternative livelihood for coastal fishermen. (e):   PMMSY inter-alia supports for creation of cold chain facilities and under this scheme, during the last five years (FY2020-21 to FY2024-25), proposals for development of 734 cold storages and ice plants, 27,301 units of fish transportation facilities such as 10924 motorcycles with ice boxes, 9412 bicycles with ice boxes, 3915 auto rickshaws, 1265 Live fish Vending units, 1406 insulated trucks and 379 refrigerated trucks, 6410 fish Kiosks, 202 fish retail fish markets, 21 wholesale fish markets have been approved. The Government of Karnataka has reported that construction of 20 ice plants/cold storages of various capacities, modernization and up-gradation of a fishing harbour, purchase of 4 refrigerated vehicles, 16 insulated vehicles, 7 three-wheelers with ice boxes and 15 motorcycles with ice boxes have been supported under PMMSY in Dakshina Kannada District of Karnataka. (f):       The Department of Fisheries, Government of India has so far accorded approvals to the proposals of Government of Odisha for development of fisheries and aquaculture including infrastructure at a total cost of Rs.1298.25 crore under PMMSY. This includes development of one fishing harbour, 38 ice plants/cold storages, livelihood support to 68000 fishers families, insurance coverage of 53,91,593 fishers with an average of about 1.08 lakh annually in the State of Odisha. Under the PMMSY scheme, identification of the beneficiaries effectively covering the beneficiaries in various districts and extending the benefits of PMMSY to the eligible beneficiaries is done by the Government of Odisha. (g):       The Department of Fisheries, Government of India is presently implementing Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana and only 100 coastal fishermen villages are identified as of now for development as Climate Resilient Coastal Fishermen Villages under this ongoing scheme.

                17 DEC 2025 11:29AM by PIB Delhi The Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Government of India has undertaken different schemes and programmes namely Blue Revolution, Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF), Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) and Pradhan Mantri Matsya Samridhi Sah Yojana (PM-MKSSY) from 2015-16 for development of fisheries sector in the country with an investment worth ₹38,572 crore. As a result of the concerted efforts of Government through these schemes and well-thought policies, the annual fish production has increased to 195 lakh tonne (p) (FY 2024-25) from 95.79 lakh tonne (FY 2013-14) registering growth of 103%. The Seafood exports have also doubled from ₹30,213 crore in 2014-15 to ₹62,408 crore in 2024-25 registering growth of 107%, with share of value-added products rising from 2% to 11%. Under PMMSY, during 2020-21 to 2024-25, the Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying has so far approved fisheries development proposals worth ₹21,274.16 crore  with central share of ₹9,189.79 crore. To enhance India’s global competitiveness in fisheries sector, the PMMSY supports a basket of interventions/activities along the fisheries value chain including quality fish production, expansion, diversification and intensification of brackish water aquaculture, promotion of export-oriented species, infusion of technology, robust disease management and traceability, training and capacity building, creation of modern post-harvest infrastructure with seamless cold chain, development of modern fishing harbours and fish landing centres etc. During last five years, the PMMSY has contributed significantly  in overall growth of the fisheries and aquaculture especially, (i) increase of annual fish production from 141.64 lakh tonne in 2019-20 to 195 lakh tonne (p) in 2024-25 registering growth of 38%, (ii) increase in fisheries export from ₹46,662.85 crore in 2019-20 to ₹62,408 crore in 2024-25 registering growth of 34%. To take forward the achievements of PMMSY, on the occasion of World Fisheries Day i.e. 21 st November, 2025, the National Framework on Traceability in Fisheries and Aquaculture 2025 was released as a sub activity under PM-MKSSY with the aims and objectives to establish a national digital traceability system across the fisheries and aquaculture value chains, ensure regulatory compliance for both domestic standards and international requirements for fish and fishery products, promote food safety and quality assurance, bring transparency, accountability and enhancing consumer confidence, facilitate market access for small-scale fishers and farmers in domestic and international trade ultimately boosting export. As the framework has been launched recently on 21.11.2025, it does not warrant any review at this stage. Besides, the Department of Fisheries has not undertaken any pilot projects on traceability so far. The framework provides for a National Level Governance Committee (NLGC) as an apex body providing strategic oversight, inter-agency coordination and policy guidance to ensure the effective implementation of the framework. It also provides for an Adoption Committee under the overall guidance of NLGC to recommend mechanism for adoption of IT based national traceability system in fisheries and aquaculture by different stakeholders including fishermen, aquaculture farmers and related stakeholders. Further, it also provides for adequate support for training and capacity building of the stakeholders particularly small-scale operators for adoption of the digital traceability framework.

                17 DEC 2025 3:33PM by PIB Delhi As per Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India, subjects of Police and Public Order are with the State Governments. However, the Government of India (GoI) has been supplementing the efforts of States affected by Left Wing Extremism (LWE). To address the LWE menace holistically, a “National Policy and Action Plan to address LWE” was approved in 2015. It envisages a multi-pronged strategy involving security related measures, development interventions, ensuring rights and entitlements of local communities etc. The resolute implementation of the National Policy and Action Plan 2015 has resulted in consistent decline in violence and constriction of geographical spread. LWE which has been a serious challenge to the internal security of the nation has been significantly curbed in the recent times and has been constricted to only a few pockets. The LWE perpetrated violence incidents have come down from high of 1936 in year 2010 by 89% to 222 in 2025. Resultant deaths of Civilians & Security Forces have also come down from high of 1005 in year 2010 by 91% to 95 in year 2025. The number of LWE- affected districts reduced from 126 to 90 in April-2018, 70 in July-2021, 38 in April-2024, 18 in April-2025 and only 11 in October-2025 with only 3 districts now categorized as Most LWE Affected. The government’s focus on development in tribal and remote areas has addressed the root cause of Naxalism.

                        17 DEC 2025 3:33PM by PIB Delhi As per Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India, subjects of Police and Public Order are with the State Governments. However, the Government of India (GoI) has been supplementing the efforts of States affected by Left Wing Extremism (LWE). To address the LWE menace holistically, a “National Policy and Action Plan to address LWE” was approved in 2015. It envisages a multi-pronged strategy involving security related measures, development interventions, ensuring rights and entitlements of local communities etc. The resolute implementation of the National Policy and Action Plan 2015 has resulted in consistent decline in violence and constriction of geographical spread. LWE which has been a serious challenge to the internal security of the nation has been significantly curbed in the recent times and has been constricted to only a few pockets. The LWE perpetrated violence incidents have come down from high of 1936 in year 2010 by 89% to 222 in 2025. Resultant deaths of Civilians & Security Forces have also come down from high of 1005 in year 2010 by 91% to 95 in year 2025.

                17 DEC 2025 3:55PM by PIB Delhi The Over-the-Top (OTT) sector has significantly contributed towards India’s soft power by enabling global access to Indian stories, creative talent, cultural heritage, and independent filmmaking. As per industry estimates (FICCI-EY Media & Entertainment Industry Report 2025), the video subscription revenues grew at 11% in 2024 to reach Rs. 9,200 cr. The number of users paying for streaming content on OTT are estimated between 9.5-11.8 crore individuals. Public Broadcaster’s platform WAVES OTT has further strengthened this outreach by making Doordarshan and All India Radio’s rich archives, regional arts, documentaries, classical music, literature-based programming, and multilingual content accessible to audiences worldwide. WAVES OTT has introduced a framework to support emerging filmmakers and creators, providing them with a technology-driven distribution platform to reach diverse global audiences. WAVES OTT is primarily a subscription-free public service platform and does not operate on a subscription-based model. Advertising is its main source of revenue. It focuses on democratising access to public broadcasting content across India and globally. The platform is currently in a growth and expansion phase, with a steadily increasing international user footprint. Revenue streams from international markets are being progressively developed through strategic partnerships. User growth has shown a significant upward trend with more than 80 Lakh downloads users in the first year of launch. This reflects the rising demand for multilingual Indian content and public service media on digital platforms. The newly inserted Section 7(1B)(ii) of the Cinematograph Act, 1952 (as amended in 2023), empowers the Central Government, under Section 79(3) of the Information Technology Act, 2000 to take remedial action against intermediaries hosting pirated film contents.

                17 DEC 2025 2:23PM by PIB Delhi The policies of the Government are aimed at ensuring an Open, Safe and Trusted and Accountable Internet for its users, including women and children. The Government is committed to ensure that the Internet in India is free from any form of unlawful content or information, particularly vulgar and obscene content. Legal frameworks to counter unlawful content on digital platforms Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000 The IT Act and the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (IT Rules, 2021), together, have put in place a stringent framework to deal with unlawful and harmful content in the digital space. It imposes clear obligations on intermediaries to ensure accountability. The IT Act provides punishment for various cyber offences such as privacy violations (section 66E), publishing or transmitting obscene or sexually explicit content (sections 67, 67A, 67B). It also empowers Police to investigate offences (section 78), enter public place and search and arrest suspected person (section 80). IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 The IT Rules, 2021 cast due-diligence obligations on intermediaries, including social media intermediaries, and require them to implement these obligations effectively so as to prevent the hosting or transmission of unlawful content. Key provisions under IT Rules, 2021: Provision Details Restricted information under Rule 3(1)(b) Restricts hosting, storing, transmitting, displaying or publishing information/content that, among other things, is: obscene, pornographic, invasive of another’s privacy, insulting or harassing on the basis of gender, racially or ethnically objectionable, or promoting hate or violence; harmful to child; deceives or misleads, including through deepfakes; impersonates others, including via Artificial Intelligence; threatens national security or public order; violates any applicable law. User Awareness Obligations Intermediaries must clearly inform users through terms of service and user agreements about the consequences of sharing unlawful content, including content removal, account suspension, or termination. Accountability in Content Removal Intermediaries must act expeditiously to remove unlawful content upon court orders, reasoned intimation from Government, or user grievances, within prescribed timelines. Grievance Redressal Intermediaries to appoint Grievance Officers Mandates to resolve complaints through removal of unlawful content within 72 hours. Content violating privacy, impersonating individuals, or showing nudity must be removed within 24 hours against any such complaint. Grievance Appellate Committees (GACs) Mechanism Users can appeal online at www.gac.gov.in if their complaints are not addressed by the intermediaries’ Grievance Officers. GACs ensure accountability and transparency of content moderation decisions. Assistance by Intermediaries to Government Agencies Intermediaries must provide information under their control or assistance to authorised Government agencies for identity verification, or for the prevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution of offences, including cyber security incidents. Additional Obligations of significant social media intermediaries (SSMIs) (i.e., social media intermediaries having 50 lakhs or above registered user base in India) SSMIs offering messaging services must help law enforcement trace originators of serious or sensitive content. SSMIs to use automated tools to detect and limit spread of certain unlawful content. SSMIs to publish compliance reports, appoint local officers, and share physical address based in India for compliances and law enforcement coordination. SSMIs to offer voluntary user verification, internal appeals, and fair hearing before taking suo-moto action. In case of failure of the intermediaries to observe the legal obligations as provided in the IT Rules, 2021, they lose their exemption from third party information provided under section 79 of the IT Act. They are liable for consequential action or prosecution as provided under any extant law. Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023 The BNS, 2023 strengthens the legal framework to address offences involving online harm, obscenity, misinformation and other cyber-enabled crimes, including those committed through social media platforms. Provides punishment for offences like obscene acts (Section 296), sale of obscene material including display of any such content in electronic form (Section 294) Similarly, to address the negative effects of harmful content on OTT platforms, Government has notified the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media, Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 on 25.02.2021 under IT Act, 2000. Part-III of the rules provides for a Code of Ethics for digital news publishers and publishers of online curated content (OTT platforms). OTT platforms are under obligation not to transmit any content which is prohibited by law for the time being in force. The Government has so far disabled public access in India for 43 OTT platforms for displaying obscene content. The Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting and Parliamentary Affairs, Dr. L.

                17 DEC 2025 12:47PM by PIB Delhi The population of Parsis (Zoroastrians), a notified minority community under the National Commission of Minorities Act 1992, has declined from 1,14,000 in 1941 to 57,264 in 2011 as per census data. In order to arrest the decline in population and reverse the trend, the Government of India through the Ministry of Minority Affairs launched the Jiyo Parsi Scheme in 2013-14. The scheme has three components: i) Medical Assistance – to provide financial assistance to Parsi couples for treatment for infertility, pregnancy complications and new-born complications; this is available to Parsi couples with annual family income upto Rs 30 lakh. ii) Health of Community – to provide financial assistance to Parsi couples towards care of children and dependent elderly family members; this is available to Parsi couples with annual family income upto Rs 15 lakh. iii) Advocacy – to create awareness about the benefits available under the scheme. The assistance under the scheme is being released to the beneficiaries through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode after biometric authentication and other verifications by the respective State Governments. During the last 5 years (i.e., 2020-21 to 2024-25), expenditure of Rs 17.64 crore was incurred and 232 babies were born under the scheme. An evaluation study of the scheme was conducted by International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) during 2025. According to the report submitted by IIPS, the scheme has been largely successful in reaching its intended population and there was a near-universal acknowledgement among the respondents about the usefulness of the scheme in increasing the Parsi population.

                17 DEC 2025 2:07PM by PIB Delhi The Ministry of Panchayati Raj launched SabhaSaar, an AI-enabled voice-to-text meeting summarisation tool, on 14th August 2025. SabhaSaar has been made available to all States/UTs, and Gram Panchayats are progressively adopting it for routine Gram Sabha and Panchayat meetings. As part of the pilot phase, all 1,194 Gram Panchayats of Tripura were encouraged to use the tool for the Special Gram Sabhas on 15 August 2025, and 1,047 (87%) Gram Panchayats successfully used SabhaSaar on that day. A total of 12,667 Gram Panchayats used SabhaSaar on 15 August 2025, which increased to 77,198 Gram Panchayats during the Gram Sabha held on 2 October 2025. As on 03.12.2025, a total of 92,376 Gram Panchayats have used the SabhaSaar tool for automated meeting summarisation across States/UTs. The State and district-wise details are placed at Annexure I and Annexure II . The Ministry is continuously striving to create greater awareness about the functionalities of SabhaSaar. Due to the simplicity of its use, a standard operating procedure was conveyed to the States/UTs which conveyed it further to the Panchayats. Several physical and virtual sessions have been organised by the Ministry for State/UT officials to demonstrate the functionality. The States took further action to disseminate the information among Panchayats. The AI model used in SabhaSaar operates on AI and cloud infrastructure provisioned through the India AI Compute Portal under the India AI Mission of MeitY. Data is processed within the Government framework and is not shared with any external third-party service provider. The India AI Mission under MeitY serves as the nodal agency for governance of the underlying AI infrastructure and the data generated, thereof.

                        17 DEC 2025 2:07PM by PIB Delhi The Ministry of Panchayati Raj launched SabhaSaar, an AI-enabled voice-to-text meeting summarisation tool, on 14th August 2025. SabhaSaar has been made available to all States/UTs, and Gram Panchayats are progressively adopting it for routine Gram Sabha and Panchayat meetings. As part of the pilot phase, all 1,194 Gram Panchayats of Tripura were encouraged to use the tool for the Special Gram Sabhas on 15 August 2025, and 1,047 (87%) Gram Panchayats successfully used SabhaSaar on that day. A total of 12,667 Gram Panchayats used SabhaSaar on 15 August 2025, which increased to 77,198 Gram Panchayats during the Gram Sabha held on 2 October 2025. As on 03.12.2025, a total of 92,376 Gram Panchayats have used the SabhaSaar tool for automated meeting summarisation across States/UTs. The State and district-wise details are placed at Annexure I and Annexure II . The Ministry is continuously striving to create greater awareness about the functionalities of SabhaSaar. Due to the simplicity of its use, a standard operating procedure was conveyed to the States/UTs which conveyed it further to the Panchayats. Several physical and virtual sessions have been organised by the Ministry for State/UT officials to demonstrate the functionality. The States took further action to disseminate the information among Panchayats. The AI model used in SabhaSaar operates on AI and cloud infrastructure provisioned through the India AI Compute Portal under the India AI Mission of MeitY. Data is processed within the Government framework and is not shared with any external third-party service provider. The India AI Mission under MeitY serves as the nodal agency for governance of the underlying AI infrastructure and the data generated, thereof.

                17 DEC 2025 5:12PM by PIB Delhi The regulation and oversight of gene‑editingin crops in India are guided by a comprehensive biosafety framework established under the Rules for the Manufacture, Use/Import/Export and Storage of Hazardous Micro‑organisms/Genetically Engineered Organisms or Cells, 1989 (the “Rules, 1989”), which notified under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 (EPA). The Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) administer the EPA. Development of gene‑edited (GEd) plants is conducted under strict contained‑laboratory conditions until the plants are shown to be free of exogenously introduced DNA. During this phase, Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBSCs) exercise regulatory oversight, with information reported to the Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation (RCGM). The regulatory oversight of GEd plant R&D is guided by the following: 1). Regulations and Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research and Biocontainment, 2017 2). Handbook for Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBSC), 2020 3). The notification regarding the exemption of site-directed nuclease (SDN)-1 and SDN-2 categories of genome edited plants, which are free from exogenous introduced DNA, from the provisions of Rules 7 to 11 (both inclusive) of the Rules, 1989 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 issued by the MoEF&CC vide O.M. F. No. C -12013/3/2020-CS-III dated 30 March 2022. Furthermore, the subsequent development, evaluation, and release of a genome‑edited plant as a new variety or hybrid shall be governed in accordance with all other applicable laws, acts, and regulations. 4). Pursuant to the mentioned notification the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST) notified following guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for research and development of gene-edited plants in India. i). Guidelines for the Safety Assessment of Genome Edited Plants, 2022 ii). Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for Regulatory Review of Genome Edited Plants under SDN-1 and SDN-2 Categories, 2022 In line with the regulation, investigators who have produced GEd plants free of exogenous DNA and wish to move them out of containment must submit the lab‑generated regulatory data to their IBSC seeking exemption from Rules 7‑11 of the Rules, 1989. After satisfactory review by the IBSC and acceptance of the minutes of the meeting of the IBSC by the RCGM, the IBSC conveys the exemption decision to the applicant. This mechanism aligns with international practice by distinguishing gene‑edited plants lacking foreign DNA from conventional genetically engineered plants while maintaining biosafety oversight. Category wise numbers of Biosafety Laboratories (BSL) registered with DBT is placed below. Level of Biosafety Facility Number of Laboratories BSL-1 Laboratories of this type are deemed to be at the lowest risk level. They are utilized for the study of non‑pathogenic microorganisms that present only a minimal hazard to healthy adults. In such environments, standard microbiological practices together with basic personal protective equipment (including lab coats and, where necessary, gloves), hand‑washing facilities, and easily cleanable work surfaces are required. BSL-2 750 nos. BSL-3 89 nos. BSL-4 01 nos. The crops currently being gene‑edited in these laboratories include, a wide range of species such as cotton, rice, sorghum, mung bean, banana, gerbera, saffron, tea, stevia, potato, onion, mustard, maize, pearl millet, foxtail millet, finger millet, ginger, chilli, cucumber, muskmelon, wheat, eucalyptus, pigeon pea, rice bean, groundnut, chickpea, soybean, tobacco, cauliflower, yellow sarson, rubber, apple, brinjal, sesame, papaya,ashwagandha, Artemisia annua , Coleus forskohlii , tulasi, Cannabis sativa , sunflower, urad bean, castor, sugarcane, jute, flax, Salvia officinalis , Ophiorrhiza , citrus, grass pea, lentil, black pepper, okra, and tomato. Institution wise containment facilities and details of crops undergoing gene-editing is placed as Annexure-1. During the period 2020-2025, one incidence of lab-acquired infectionhas been reported. A doctoral student of National Centre for Cell Sciences, Pune was exposed occupationally to vaccinia virus in a biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) laboratory.

********** (Release ID: 2205351) Visitor Counter : 7 Ministry of Science & Technology PARLIAMENT QUESTION: BIO-SAFETY LABORATORIES Posted On:
                        17 DEC 2025 5:12PM by PIB Delhi The regulation and oversight of gene‑editingin crops in India are guided by a comprehensive biosafety framework established under the Rules for the Manufacture, Use/Import/Export and Storage of Hazardous Micro‑organisms/Genetically Engineered Organisms or Cells, 1989 (the “Rules, 1989”), which notified under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 (EPA). The Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) administer the EPA. Development of gene‑edited (GEd) plants is conducted under strict contained‑laboratory conditions until the plants are shown to be free of exogenously introduced DNA. During this phase, Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBSCs) exercise regulatory oversight, with information reported to the Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation (RCGM). The regulatory oversight of GEd plant R&D is guided by the following: 1). Regulations and Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research and Biocontainment, 2017 2). Handbook for Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBSC), 2020 3). The notification regarding the exemption of site-directed nuclease (SDN)-1 and SDN-2 categories of genome edited plants, which are free from exogenous introduced DNA, from the provisions of Rules 7 to 11 (both inclusive) of the Rules, 1989 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 issued by the MoEF&CC vide O.M. F. No. C -12013/3/2020-CS-III dated 30 March 2022. Furthermore, the subsequent development, evaluation, and release of a genome‑edited plant as a new variety or hybrid shall be governed in accordance with all other applicable laws, acts, and regulations. 4). Pursuant to the mentioned notification the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST) notified following guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for research and development of gene-edited plants in India. i). Guidelines for the Safety Assessment of Genome Edited Plants, 2022 ii). Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for Regulatory Review of Genome Edited Plants under SDN-1 and SDN-2 Categories, 2022 In line with the regulation, investigators who have produced GEd plants free of exogenous DNA and wish to move them out of containment must submit the lab‑generated regulatory data to their IBSC seeking exemption from Rules 7‑11 of the Rules, 1989. After satisfactory review by the IBSC and acceptance of the minutes of the meeting of the IBSC by the RCGM, the IBSC conveys the exemption decision to the applicant. This mechanism aligns with international practice by distinguishing gene‑edited plants lacking foreign DNA from conventional genetically engineered plants while maintaining biosafety oversight. Category wise numbers of Biosafety Laboratories (BSL) registered with DBT is placed below. Level of Biosafety Facility Number of Laboratories BSL-1 Laboratories of this type are deemed to be at the lowest risk level. They are utilized for the study of non‑pathogenic microorganisms that present only a minimal hazard to healthy adults. In such environments, standard microbiological practices together with basic personal protective equipment (including lab coats and, where necessary, gloves), hand‑washing facilities, and easily cleanable work surfaces are required. BSL-2 750 nos. BSL-3 89 nos. BSL-4 01 nos. The crops currently being gene‑edited in these laboratories include, a wide range of species such as cotton, rice, sorghum, mung bean, banana, gerbera, saffron, tea, stevia, potato, onion, mustard, maize, pearl millet, foxtail millet, finger millet, ginger, chilli, cucumber, muskmelon, wheat, eucalyptus, pigeon pea, rice bean, groundnut, chickpea, soybean, tobacco, cauliflower, yellow sarson, rubber, apple, brinjal, sesame, papaya,ashwagandha, Artemisia annua , Coleus forskohlii , tulasi, Cannabis sativa , sunflower, urad bean, castor, sugarcane, jute, flax, Salvia officinalis , Ophiorrhiza , citrus, grass pea, lentil, black pepper, okra, and tomato. Institution wise containment facilities and details of crops undergoing gene-editing is placed as Annexure-1. During the period 2020-2025, one incidence of lab-acquired infectionhas been reported. A doctoral student of National Centre for Cell Sciences, Pune was exposed occupationally to vaccinia virus in a biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) laboratory.

                17 DEC 2025 2:55PM by PIB Delhi The Government has approved a comprehensive package of Rs. 69,725 crore featuring a four-pillar approach to strengthen domestic capacity, maritime financing, shipyard development, skilling, and reforms. Shipbuilding is considered the mother industry in heavy engineering, where the majority of the value of a built ship is contributed by heavy engineering industries such as steel, mechanical, electrical and electronic equipment, composites, etc. Further, ancillary industries also develop through the growth of the shipbuilding industry. Given shipbuilding’s high employment multiplier, there is potential for the generation of approximately 22 lakh (2.2 million) direct and indirect jobs. The Government has undertaken several measures to address both supply-side and demand-side issues in the shipbuilding sector.

Shipbuilding is considered the mother industry in heavy engineering, where the majority of the value of a built ship is contributed by heavy engineering industries such as steel, mechanical, electrical and electronic equipment, composites, etc. Further, ancillary industries also develop through the growth of the shipbuilding industry. Given shipbuilding’s high employment multiplier, there is potential for the generation of approximately 22 lakh (2.2 million) direct and indirect jobs. The Government has undertaken several measures to address both supply-side and demand-side issues in the shipbuilding sector. Stakeholder consultations have been conducted among various ministries, including cargo-generating ministries, to provide visibility for vessel orders for the shipbuilding industry.

                17 DEC 2025 2:39PM by PIB Delhi From the latest PLFS Monthly Bulletin for October 2025, the estimates of Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR), Worker population Ratio (WPR) and Unemployment Rate (UR) in Current Weekly Status (CWS) for rural, urban and rural + urban combined among male, female and person of age group 15 years and above at all-India level are given in the Table below: LFPR, WPR and UR (in per cent) according to Current Weekly Status (CWS) for rural, urban and rural+urban sectors among male, female and person of age group 15 years and above for October, 2025 sector LFPR in CWS WPR in CWS UR in CWS male female person male female person male female Person (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) rural 78.4 38.4 57.8 74.8 36.9 55.2 4.6 4.0 4.4 urban 75.3 25.4 50.5 70.8 22.9 47.0 6.1 9.7 7.0 rural+urban 77.4 34.2 55.4 73.4 32.4 52.5 5.1 5.4 5.2 Source: Monthly Bulletin, PLFS, October, 2025 The sampling design of PLFS has been revamped from January 2025 to address the requirement of high frequency labour market indicators with enhanced coverage from PLFS. Salient aspects of the change in the sampling methodology of PLFS are given below: Frequency: The revamped PLFS sample design has enabled generation of monthly estimates of key labour market indicators viz., LFPR, WPR and UR at the all-India level following the Current Weekly Status (CWS) approach. The Monthly Bulletins for the months of April 2025 to October 2025 each have been released. Upto December, 2024 PLFS provided quarterly labour market indicators for the urban areas only. In the revamped PLFS, quarterly estimates of employment-unemployment indicators are available for both rural and urban areas and hence for the entire country. Quarterly Bulletins for April-Jun 2025 and July-September 2025 have been released. Coverage: PLFS covers all the States/UTs across the country. In the revamped PLFS sample design, district has been made the primary geographical unit, called basic stratum within a State/UT separately for rural and urban sectors for selecting FSUs for most part of the geography covered. In the remaining parts, NSS region has been made the basic stratum. This will ensure presence of sample observations from most of the districts in the PLFS sample, which will improve the representativeness of the estimates generated. Further, sample size has been increased to 22,692 First Stage Units (FSUs – sample villages/ urban blocks/ sub-units) from 12800 FSUs surveyed upto December 2024 and Sample households have also been increased from 8 to 12 households. The enhanced sample size is expected to provide reliable estimates of labour market indicators with improved precision. Timely Dissemination: The results of PLFS are being released in a timely manner as per the timelines prescribed in the Advance Release Calendar (ARC) available on the website of MoSPI. The ongoing PLFS is being carried out as per NIC 2008. MoSPI has released the NIC 2025 recently in the month of November 2025. The NIC 2025 introduces a new 6-digit coding structure, in place of the 5-digit structure of NIC 2008 and represents the latest updated national standard for classifying economic activities in India which provides a comprehensive and contemporary framework for all economic activities, capturing the rapid transformation of Indian economy driven by technological advancement, innovation, and the emergence of new sectors.

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare implements the Scheme for Promotion of Menstrual Hygiene (MH) to improve it among adolescent girls (10–19 years). The scheme focuses on increasing awareness on MH, enhancing access to sanitary napkins, and promoting safe and environmentally friendly disposal practices. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare formulated the MH Policy for School Going Girls following detailed deliberations with the line Ministries. It streamlines access to low-cost MH products, gender-segregated toilets and safe disposal facilities, promotes MH education into the school curriculum, and prioritizes sensitization and awareness in all schools.

Further, one of the objectives of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) components of ‘Misson Shakti’ is to generate awareness about MH and use of sanitary napkins. The National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS 5) data shows that the percentage of women aged 15-24 years using hygienic methods during their menstrual cycles has risen from 57.6% in NFHS-4 to 77.3 % in NFHS-5. Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has developed National Guidelines on Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) for creating awareness on MHM in rural areas as part of its overall interventions related to behaviour change on sanitation and hygiene aspect. Further, Department of School Education and Literacy implements an integrated scheme namely 'Samagra Shiksha' under which State specific projects for varied interventions on menstrual health and hygiene including installation of sanitary pad vending machines and incinerators are approved. Ministry of Women and Child Development implements the Scheme for Adolescent Girls (SAG) under which, one of the components is improving their health and nutritional status and to motivate them to go back to formal schooling. Ministry of Education has issued an advisory dated 07.06.2024 to all the States/ UTs and the Heads of Autonomous bodies like Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan & Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti.

The, Department of Health Research under Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) carries out research and studies to look into the newer methods of managing menstrual health and other sustainable alternatives to sanitary napkins for their safety, acceptability, affordability, efficacy and feasibility among women in public health program setting. In addition, since 2015-16, the Menstrual Hygiene Scheme is supported by 'National Health Mission' (NHM) through State Programme Implementation Plan (PIP) route based on the proposals received from the States. The States have been instructed to take up procurement of sanitary napkin packs at prices reached through competitive bidding. In the year 2021-22, approximately 34.92 lakh adolescent girls were provided sanitary napkin pack every month as per 'Health Management Information System' (HMIS) data. The Government has also taken initiatives to improve the accessibility of sanitary napkins and good quality medicines at affordable price.

                        17 DEC 2025 1:35PM by PIB Delhi There are a number of schemes being implemented by various Ministries and Departments of the Government of India for financial and social empowerment of women, including for widows, single mothers and women in difficult circumstances. Major schemes and programmes of Government of India in this regard are as follows: - (i) The Ministry of Women and Child Development during the 15th Finance Commission period with effect from the financial year 2022-23, is implementing Centrally Sponsored Schemes in the country for the welfare of women and children, which are placed under three verticals, viz. (1) Mission Shakti, for safety, protection and empowerment of women; (2) Saksham Anganwadi & Poshan 2.0 for improving nutrition & health indicators in the country; and (3) Mission Vatsalya, for protection and welfare of vulnerable children in difficult circumstances. Details of the schemes are as under: (a) Mission Shakti : The ‘Mission Shakti’ aims at strengthening interventions for women safety, security and empowerment. It comprises of two sub-schemes ‘Sambal’ and ‘Samarthya’ for safety and security of women and empowerment of women respectively. The “Sambal” vertical is for safety and security of women and the key components namely, One Stop Centres (OSCs) which is an institution located at district level offering under one roof immediate help to women such as temporary shelter, medical & police assistance, counselling and legal support, the Women Helpline (WHL) 181 provides toll-free 24-hours telecom service to women seeking support and information. The “Samarthya” vertical is for the empowerment of women. It has the following components namely, Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) under which cash incentive of ₹5,000/- is provided directly to the Bank/Post Office account of the pregnant women and lactating mothers in Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode for first child. Cash incentive of ₹6,000/- is also provided under PMMVY to eligible beneficiaries for second child, if it is a girl child. Shakti Sadan is an Integrated Relief and Rehabilitation Home for women in distress situations and difficult circumstances including trafficked women. Home for Widows named ‘Krishna Kutir’ set up in Vrindavan, Uttar Pradesh with a capacity to accommodate 1,000 residents to provide a safe and secure place of stay, health services, nutritious food, legal and counselling services. Sakhi Niwas (Working Women Hostel) that aims to promote availability of safe and conveniently located accommodation for working women in urban, semi-urban and even rural areas where employment opportunity for women exists. Palna is a component of day-care creche facilities that provide a safe and secure place for the children. Creche services formalise the child-care facilities hitherto considered as part of domestic work and use Anganwadi infrastructure for ensuring delivery of care facilities till the last mile. The SANKALP: Hub for Empowerment of Women (HEW) serves as a vehicle to bridge the information and knowledge gap regarding schemes and facilities available for women. (b) Under Mission Poshan 2.0 , Anganwadi Services, POSHAN Abhiyaan and Scheme for Adolescent Girls has been reorganized into 3 primary verticals: (i) Promotion of nutritional health & well-being for children below the age of 6 years, Pregnant Women, Lactating Mothers and Adolescent Girls (14 -18 years); (ii) Early Childhood Care and Education [3-6 years] and (iii) Anganwadi Infrastructure including modern, upgraded Saksham Anganwadi.

                18 DEC 2025 2:45PM by PIB Delhi नमस्ते! अहलन व सहलन !!! ये युवा जोश आपकी एनर्जी यहां का पूरा atmosphere चार्ज हो गया है। मैं उन सब भाई बहनों को भी नमस्कार करता हूँ, जो जगह की कमी के कारण, इस हॉल में नहीं हैं, और पास के हॉल में स्क्रीन पर यह प्रोग्राम लाइव देख रहें हैं। अब आप कल्पना कर सकते हैं, कि यहाँ तक आएं और अंदर तक नहीं आ पाएं तोह उनके दिल में क्या होता होगा। साथियों, मैं मेरे सामने एक मिनी इंडिया देख रहा हूं, मुझे लगता है यहां बहुत सारे मलयाली भी हैं। सुखम आणो ? औऱ सिर्फ मलयालम नहीं, यहां तमिल, तेलुगू, कन्नड़ा और गुजराती बोलने वाले बहुत सारे लोग भी हैं। नलमा? बागुन्नारा? चेन्ना-गिद्दिरा? केम छो? साथियों, आज हम एक फैमिली की तरह इकट्ठा हुए हैं। आज हम अपने देश को, अपनी टीम इंडिया को सेलिब्रेट कर रहे हैं। साथियों, भारत में हमारी diversity, हमारी संस्कृति का मजबूत आधार है। हमारे लिए हर दिन एक नया रंग लेकर आता है। हर मौसम एक नया उत्सव बन जाता है। हर परंपरा एक नई सोच के साथ आती है। और यही कारण है कि हम भारतीय कहीं भी जाएं, कहीं भी रहें, हम diversity का सम्मान करते हैं। हम वहां के कल्चर, वहां के नियम-कायदों के साथ घुलमिल जाते हैं। ओमान में भी मैं आज यही होते हुए अपनी आंखों के सामने देख रहा हूं। यह भारत का डायस्पोरा co-existence का, co-operation का, एक लिविंग Example बना हुआ है। साथियों, भारत की इसी समृद्ध सांस्कृतिक विरासत का एक और अद्भुत सम्मान हाल ही में मिला है। आपको शायद पता होगा, यूनेस्को ने दिवाली को Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity में शामिल किया है। अब दिवाली का दिया हमारे घर को ही नहीं, पूरी दुनिया को रोशन करेगा। यह दुनिया भर में बसे प्रत्येक भारतीय के लिए गर्व का विषय है। दिवाली की यह वैश्विक पहचान हमारी उस रोशनी की मान्यता है, जो आशा, सद्भाव, और मानवता के संदेश को, उस प्रकाश को फैलाती है। साथियों, आज हम सब यहां भारत-ओमान ""मैत्री पर्व” भी मना रहे हैं। मैत्री यानि: M से maritime heritage A से Aspirations I से Innovation T से Trust and technology R से Respect I से Inclusive growth यानि ये ""मैत्री पर्व,” हम दोनों देशों की दोस्ती, हमारी शेयर्ड हिस्ट्री, और prosperous future का उत्सव हैं। भारत और ओमान के बीच शताब्दियों से एक आत्मीय और जीवंत नाता रहा है। Indian Ocean की Monsoon Winds ने दोनों देशों के बीच ट्रेड को दिशा दी है। हमारे पूर्वज लोथल, मांडवी, और तामरालिप्ति जैसे पोर्ट्स से लकड़ी की नाव लेकर मस्कट, सूर, और सलालाह तक आते थे। और साथियों, मुझे खुशी है कि मांडवी टू मस्कट के इन ऐतिहासिक संबंधों को हमारी एंबेसी ने एक किताब में भी समेटा है। मैं चाहूंगा कि यहां रहने वाला हर साथी, हर नौजवान इसको पढ़े, और अपने ओमानी दोस्तों को भी ये गिफ्ट करे। अब आपको लगेगा की स्कूल में भी मास्टरजी होमवर्क देते हैं, और इधर मोदीजी ने भी होमवर्क दे दिया। साथियों, ये किताब बताती है कि भारत और ओमान सिर्फ Geography से नहीं, बल्कि Generations से जुड़े हुए हैं। और आप सभी सैकड़ों वर्षों के इन संबंधों के सबसे बड़े Custodians हैं। साथियों, मुझे भारत को जानिए क्विज़ में ओमान के participation बारे में भी पता चला है। ओमान से Ten thousand से अधिक लोगों ने इस क्विज में participate किया। ओमान, ग्लोबली फोर्थ पोज़िशन पर रहा है। लेकिन में तालियां नहीं बजाऊंगा। ओमान तो नंबर एक पे होना चाहिए। मैं चाहूँगा कि ओमान की भागीदारी और अधिक बढ़े, ज्यादा से ज्यादा संख्या में लोग जुड़ें। भारतीय बच्चे तो इसमें भाग ज़रूर लें। आप ओमान के अपने दोस्तों को भी इस क्विज़ का हिस्सा बनने के लिए मोटिवेट करें। साथियों, भारत और ओमान के बीच जो रिश्ता ट्रेड से शुरू हुआ था, आज उसको education सशक्त कर रही है। मुझे बताया गया है कि यहां के भारतीय स्कूलों में करीब फोर्टी सिक्स थाउज़ेंड स्टूड़ेंट्स पढ़ाई कर रहे हैं। इनमें ओमान में रहने वाले अन्य समुदायों के भी हज़ारों बच्चे शामिल हैं। ओमान में भारतीय शिक्षा के पचास वर्ष पूरे हो रहे हैं। ये हम दोनों देशों के संबंधों का एक बहुत बड़ा पड़ाव है। साथियों, भारतीय स्कूलों की ये सफलता His Majesty the Late सुल्तान क़ाबूस के प्रयासों के बिना संभव नहीं थी। उन्होंने Indian School मस्कत सहित अनेक भारतीय स्कूलों के लिए ज़मीन दी हर ज़रूरी मदद की। इस परंपरा को His Majesty सुल्तान हैथम ने आगे बढ़ाया। वे जिस प्रकार यहां भारतीयों का सहयोग करते हैं, संरक्षण देते हैं, इसके लिए मैं उनका विशेष तौर पर आभार व्यक्त करता हूं। साथियों, आप सभी परीक्षा पे चर्चा कार्यक्रम से भी परिचित हैं। यहां ओमान से काफी सारे बच्चे भी इस प्रोग्राम से जुड़ते हैं। मुझे यकीन है, कि यह चर्चा आपके काम आती होगी, पैरेंट्स हों या स्टूडेंट्स, सभी को stress-free तरीके से exam देने में हमारी बातचीत बहुत मदद करती है। साथियों, ओमान में रहने वाले भारतीय अक्सर भारत आते-जाते रहते हैं। आप भारत की हर घटना से अपडेट रहते हैं। आप सभी देख रहे हैं कि आज हमारा भारत कैसे प्रगति की नई गति से आगे बढ़ रहा है। भारत की गति हमारे इरादों में दिख रही है, हमारी परफॉर्मेंस में नज़र आती है। कुछ दिन पहले ही इकॉनॉमिक ग्रोथ के आंकड़े आए हैं, और आपको पता होगा, भारत की ग्रोथ 8 परसेंट से अधिक रही है। यानि भारत, लगातार दुनिया की Fastest growing major economy बना हुआ है। ये तब हुआ है, जब पूरी दुनिया चुनौतियों से घिरी हुई है। दुनिया की बड़ी-बड़ी economies, कुछ ही परसेंट ग्रोथ अचीव करने के लिए तरस गई हैं। लेकिन भारत लगातार हाई ग्रोथ के पथ पर चल रहा है। ये दिखाता है कि भारत का सामर्थ्य आज क्या है। साथियों, भारत आज हर सेक्टर में हर मोर्चे पर अभूतपूर्व गति के साथ काम कर रहा है। मैं आज आपको बीते 11 साल के आंकड़े देता हूं। आपको भी सुनकर गर्व होगा। यहां क्योंकि बहुत बड़ी संख्या में, स्टूडेंट्स और पेरेंट्स आए हैं, तो शुरुआत मैं शिक्षा और कौशल के सेक्टर से ही बात करुंगा। बीते 11 साल में भारत में हज़ारों नए कॉलेज बनाए गए हैं। I.I.T’s की संख्या सोलह से बढ़कर तेईस हो चुकी है। 11 वर्ष पहले भारत में 13 IIM थे, आज 21 हैं। इसी तरह AIIMs की बात करुं तो 2014 से पहले सिर्फ 7 एम्स ही बने थे। आज भारत में 22 एम्स हैं। मेडिकल कॉलेज 400 से भी कम थे, आज भारत में करीब 800 मेडिकल कॉलेज हैं। साथियों, आज हम विकसित भारत के लिए अपने एजुकेशन और स्किल इकोसिस्टम को तैयार कर रहे हैं। न्यू एजुकेशन पॉलिसी इसमें बहुत बड़ी भूमिका निभा रही है। इस पॉलिसी के मॉडल के रूप में चौदह हज़ार से अधिक पीएम श्री स्कूल भी खोले जा रहे हैं। साथियों, जब स्कूल बढ़ते हैं, कॉलेज बढ़ते हैं, यूनिवर्सिटीज़ बढ़ती हैं तो सिर्फ़ इमारतें नहीं बनतीं देश का भविष्य मज़बूत होता है। साथियों, भारत के विकास की स्पीड और स्केल शिक्षा के साथ ही अन्य क्षेत्रों में भी दिखती है। बीते 11 वर्षों में हमारी Solar Energy Installed Capacity 30 गुना बढ़ी है, Solar module manufacturing 10 गुना बढ़ी है, यानि भारत आज ग्रीन ग्रोथ की तरफ तेजी से कदम आगे बढ़ा रहा है। आज भारत दुनिया का सबसे बड़ा फिनटेक इकोसिस्टम है। दुनिया का दूसरा सबसे बड़ा Steel Producer है। दूसरा सबसे बड़ा Mobile Manufacturer है। साथियों, आज जो भी भारत आता है तो हमारे आधुनिक इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर को देखकर हैरान रह जाता है। ये इसलिए संभव हो पा रहा है क्योंकि बीते 11 वर्षों में हमने इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर पर पांच गुना अधिक निवेश किया है। Airports की संख्या double हो गई है। आज हर रोज, पहले की तुलना में डबल स्पीड से हाइवे बन रहे हैं, तेज़ गति से रेल लाइन बिछ रही हैं, रेलवे का इलेक्ट्रिफिकेशन हो रहा है। साथियों, ये आंकड़े सिर्फ उपलब्धियों के ही नहीं हैं। ये विकसित भारत के संकल्प तक पहुंचने वाली सीढ़ियां हैं। 21वीं सदी का भारत बड़े फैसले लेता है। तेज़ी से निर्णय लेता है, बड़े लक्ष्यों के साथ आगे बढ़ता है, और एक तय टाइमलाइन पर रिजल्ट लाकर ही दम लेता है। साथियों, मैं आपको गर्व की एक और बात बताता हूं। आज भारत, दुनिया का सबसे बड़ा digital public infrastructure बना रहा है। भारत का UPI यानि यूनिफाइड पेमेंट्स इंटरफेस, दुनिया का सबसे बड़ा रियल टाइम डिजिटल पेमेंट सिस्टम है। आपको ये बताने के लिए कि इस पेमेंट सिस्टम का स्केल क्या है, मैं एक छोटा सा Example देता हूं। मुझे यहाँ आ कर के करीब 30 मिनट्स हुए हैं। इन 30 मिनट में भारत में यूपीआई से फोर्टीन मिलियन रियल टाइम डिजिटल पेमेंट्स हुए हैं। इन ट्रांजैक्शन्स की टोटल वैल्यू, ट्वेंटी बिलियन रुपीज़ से ज्यादा है। भारत में बड़े से बड़े शोरूम से लेकर एक छोटे से वेंडर तक सब इस पेमेंट सिस्टम से जुड़े हुए हैं। साथियों, यहां इतने सारे स्टूडेंट्स हैं। मैं आपको एक और दिलचस्प उदाहरण दूंगा। भारत ने डिजीलॉकर की आधुनिक व्यवस्था बनाई है। भारत में बोर्ड के एग्ज़ाम होते हैं, तो मार्कशीट सीधे बच्चों के डिजीलॉकर अकाउंट में आती है। जन्म से लेकर बुढ़ापे तक, जो भी डॉक्युमेंट सरकार जेनरेट करती है, वो डिजीलॉकर में रखा जा सकता है। ऐसे बहुत सारे डिजिटल सिस्टम आज भारत में ease of living सुनिश्चित कर रहे हैं। साथियों, भारत के चंद्रयान का कमाल भी आप सभी ने देखा है। भारत दुनिया का पहला ऐसा देश है, जो मून के साउथ पोल तक पहुंचा है, सिर्फ इतना ही नहीं, हमने एक बार में 104 सैटेलाइट्स को एक साथ लॉन्च करने का कीर्तिमान भी बनाया है। अब भारत अपने गगनयान से पहला ह्युमेन स्पेस मिशन भी भेजने जा रहा है। और वो समय भी दूर नहीं जब अंतरिक्ष में भारत का अपना खुद का स्पेस स्टेशन भी होगा। साथियों, भारत का स्पेस प्रोग्राम सिर्फ अपने तक सीमित नहीं है, हम ओमान की स्पेस एस्पिरेशन्स को भी सपोर्ट कर रहे हैं। 6-7 साल पहले हमने space cooperation को लेकर एक समझौता किया था। मुझे बताते हुए खुशी है कि, ISRO ने India–Oman Space Portal विकसित किया है। अब हमारा प्रयास है कि ओमान के युवाओं को भी इस स्पेस पार्टनरशिप का लाभ मिले। मैं यहां बैठे स्टूडेंट्स को एक और जानकारी दूंगा। इसरो, ""YUVIKA” नाम से एक स्पेशल प्रोग्राम चलाता है। इसमें भारत के हज़ारों स्टूडेंट्स space science से जुड़े हैं। अब हमारा प्रयास है कि इस प्रोग्राम में ओमानी स्टूडेंट्स को भी मौका मिले। मैं चाहूंगा कि ओमान के कुछ स्टूडेंट्स, बैंगलुरु में ISRO के सेंटर में आएं, वहां कुछ समय गुज़ारें। ये ओमान के युवाओं की स्पेस एस्पिरेशन्स को नई बुलंदी देने की बेहतरीन शुरुआत हो सकती है। साथियों, आज भारत, अपनी समस्याओं के सोल्यूशन्स तो खोज ही रहा है ये सॉल्यूशन्स दुनिया के करोड़ों लोगों का जीवन कैसे बेहतर बना सकते हैं इस पर भी काम कर रहा है। software development से लेकर payroll management तक, data analysis से लेकर customer support तक अनेक global brands भारत के टैलेंट की ताकत से आगे बढ़ रहे हैं। दशकों से भारत IT और IT-enabled services का global powerhouse रहा है। अब हम manufacturing को IT की ताक़त के साथ जोड़ रहे हैं। और इसके पीछे की सोच वसुधैव कुटुंबकम से ही प्रेरित है। यानि Make in India, Make for the World. साथियों, वैक्सीन्स हों या जेनरिक medicines, दुनिया हमें फार्मेसी of the World कहती है। यानि भारत के affordable और क्वालिटी हेल्थकेयर सोल्यूशन्स दुनिया के करोड़ों लोगों का जीवन बचा रहे हैं। कोविड के दौरान भारत ने करीब 30 करोड़ vaccines दुनिया को भेजी थीं। मुझे संतोष है कि करीब, one hundred thousand मेड इन इंडिया कोविड वैक्सीन्स ओमान के लोगों के काम आ सकीं। और साथियों, याद कीजिए, ये काम भारत ने तब किया, जब हर कोई अपने बारे में सोच रहा था। तब हम दुनिया की चिंता करते थे। भारत ने अपने 140 करोड़ नागरिकों को भी रिकॉर्ड टाइम में वैक्सीन्स लगाईं, और दुनिया की ज़रूरतें भी पूरी कीं। ये भारत का मॉडल है, ऐसा मॉडल, जो twenty first century की दुनिया को नई उम्मीद देता है। इसलिए आज जब भारत मेड इन इंडिया Chips बना रहा है, AI, क्वांटम कंप्यूटिंग और ग्रीन हाइड्रोजन को लेकर मिशन मोड पर काम कर रहा है, तब दुनिया के अन्य देशों में भी उम्मीद जगती है, कि भारत की सफलता से उन्हें भी सहयोग मिलेगा। साथियों, आप यहां ओमान में पढ़ाई कर रहे हैं, यहां काम कर रहे हैं। आने वाले समय में आप ओमान के विकास में, भारत के विकास में बहुत बड़ी भूमिका निभाएंगे। आप दुनिया को लीडरशिप देने वाली पीढ़ी हैं। ओमान में रहने वाले भारतीयों को असुविधा न हो, इसके लिए यहां की सरकार हर संभव सहयोग दे रही है। भारत सरकार भी आपकी सुविधा का पूरा ध्यान रख रही है। पूरे ओमान में 11 काउंसलर सर्विस सेंटर्स खोले हैं। साथियों, बीते दशक में जितने भी वैश्विक संकट आए हैं, उनमें हमारी सरकार ने तेज़ी से भारतीयों की मदद की है। दुनिया में जहां भी भारतीय रहते हैं, हमारी सरकार कदम-कदम पर उनके साथ है। इसके लिए Indian Community Welfare Fund, मदद पोर्टल, और प्रवासी भारतीय बीमा योजना जैसे प्रयास किए गए हैं। साथियों, भारत के लिए ये पूरा क्षेत्र बहुत ही स्पेशल है, और ओमान हमारे लिए और भी विशेष है। मुझे खुशी है कि भारत-ओमान का रिश्ता अब skill development, digital learning, student exchange और entrepreneurship तक पहुंच रहा है। मुझे विश्वास है आपके बीच से ऐसे young innovators निकलेंगे जो आने वाले वर्षों में India–Oman relationship को नई ऊंचाई पर ले जाएंगे। अभी यहां भारतीय स्कूलों ने अपने 50 साल celebrate किए हैं। अब हमें अगले 50 साल के लक्ष्यों के साथ आगे बढ़ना है। इसलिए मैं हर youth से कहना चाहूंगा : Dream big. Learn deeply. Innovate boldly. क्योंकि आपका future सिर्फ आपका नहीं है, बल्कि पूरी मानवता का भविष्य है। आप सभी को एक बार फिर उज्जवल भविष्य की बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं। बहुत-बहुत धन्यवाद!

                        18 DEC 2025 2:45PM by PIB Delhi नमस्ते! अहलन व सहलन !!! ये युवा जोश आपकी एनर्जी यहां का पूरा atmosphere चार्ज हो गया है। मैं उन सब भाई बहनों को भी नमस्कार करता हूँ, जो जगह की कमी के कारण, इस हॉल में नहीं हैं, और पास के हॉल में स्क्रीन पर यह प्रोग्राम लाइव देख रहें हैं। अब आप कल्पना कर सकते हैं, कि यहाँ तक आएं और अंदर तक नहीं आ पाएं तोह उनके दिल में क्या होता होगा। साथियों, मैं मेरे सामने एक मिनी इंडिया देख रहा हूं, मुझे लगता है यहां बहुत सारे मलयाली भी हैं। सुखम आणो ? औऱ सिर्फ मलयालम नहीं, यहां तमिल, तेलुगू, कन्नड़ा और गुजराती बोलने वाले बहुत सारे लोग भी हैं। नलमा? बागुन्नारा? चेन्ना-गिद्दिरा? केम छो? साथियों, आज हम एक फैमिली की तरह इकट्ठा हुए हैं। आज हम अपने देश को, अपनी टीम इंडिया को सेलिब्रेट कर रहे हैं। साथियों, भारत में हमारी diversity, हमारी संस्कृति का मजबूत आधार है। हमारे लिए हर दिन एक नया रंग लेकर आता है। हर मौसम एक नया उत्सव बन जाता है। हर परंपरा एक नई सोच के साथ आती है। और यही कारण है कि हम भारतीय कहीं भी जाएं, कहीं भी रहें, हम diversity का सम्मान करते हैं। हम वहां के कल्चर, वहां के नियम-कायदों के साथ घुलमिल जाते हैं। ओमान में भी मैं आज यही होते हुए अपनी आंखों के सामने देख रहा हूं। यह भारत का डायस्पोरा co-existence का, co-operation का, एक लिविंग Example बना हुआ है। साथियों, भारत की इसी समृद्ध सांस्कृतिक विरासत का एक और अद्भुत सम्मान हाल ही में मिला है। आपको शायद पता होगा, यूनेस्को ने दिवाली को Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity में शामिल किया है। अब दिवाली का दिया हमारे घर को ही नहीं, पूरी दुनिया को रोशन करेगा। यह दुनिया भर में बसे प्रत्येक भारतीय के लिए गर्व का विषय है। दिवाली की यह वैश्विक पहचान हमारी उस रोशनी की मान्यता है, जो आशा, सद्भाव, और मानवता के संदेश को, उस प्रकाश को फैलाती है। साथियों, आज हम सब यहां भारत-ओमान ""मैत्री पर्व” भी मना रहे हैं। मैत्री यानि: M से maritime heritage A से Aspirations I से Innovation T से Trust and technology R से Respect I से Inclusive growth यानि ये ""मैत्री पर्व,” हम दोनों देशों की दोस्ती, हमारी शेयर्ड हिस्ट्री, और prosperous future का उत्सव हैं। भारत और ओमान के बीच शताब्दियों से एक आत्मीय और जीवंत नाता रहा है। Indian Ocean की Monsoon Winds ने दोनों देशों के बीच ट्रेड को दिशा दी है। हमारे पूर्वज लोथल, मांडवी, और तामरालिप्ति जैसे पोर्ट्स से लकड़ी की नाव लेकर मस्कट, सूर, और सलालाह तक आते थे। और साथियों, मुझे खुशी है कि मांडवी टू मस्कट के इन ऐतिहासिक संबंधों को हमारी एंबेसी ने एक किताब में भी समेटा है। मैं चाहूंगा कि यहां रहने वाला हर साथी, हर नौजवान इसको पढ़े, और अपने ओमानी दोस्तों को भी ये गिफ्ट करे। अब आपको लगेगा की स्कूल में भी मास्टरजी होमवर्क देते हैं, और इधर मोदीजी ने भी होमवर्क दे दिया। साथियों, ये किताब बताती है कि भारत और ओमान सिर्फ Geography से नहीं, बल्कि Generations से जुड़े हुए हैं। और आप सभी सैकड़ों वर्षों के इन संबंधों के सबसे बड़े Custodians हैं। साथियों, मुझे भारत को जानिए क्विज़ में ओमान के participation बारे में भी पता चला है। ओमान से Ten thousand से अधिक लोगों ने इस क्विज में participate किया। ओमान, ग्लोबली फोर्थ पोज़िशन पर रहा है। लेकिन में तालियां नहीं बजाऊंगा। ओमान तो नंबर एक पे होना चाहिए। मैं चाहूँगा कि ओमान की भागीदारी और अधिक बढ़े, ज्यादा से ज्यादा संख्या में लोग जुड़ें। भारतीय बच्चे तो इसमें भाग ज़रूर लें। आप ओमान के अपने दोस्तों को भी इस क्विज़ का हिस्सा बनने के लिए मोटिवेट करें। साथियों, भारत और ओमान के बीच जो रिश्ता ट्रेड से शुरू हुआ था, आज उसको education सशक्त कर रही है। मुझे बताया गया है कि यहां के भारतीय स्कूलों में करीब फोर्टी सिक्स थाउज़ेंड स्टूड़ेंट्स पढ़ाई कर रहे हैं। इनमें ओमान में रहने वाले अन्य समुदायों के भी हज़ारों बच्चे शामिल हैं। ओमान में भारतीय शिक्षा के पचास वर्ष पूरे हो रहे हैं। ये हम दोनों देशों के संबंधों का एक बहुत बड़ा पड़ाव है। साथियों, भारतीय स्कूलों की ये सफलता His Majesty the Late सुल्तान क़ाबूस के प्रयासों के बिना संभव नहीं थी। उन्होंने Indian School मस्कत सहित अनेक भारतीय स्कूलों के लिए ज़मीन दी हर ज़रूरी मदद की। इस परंपरा को His Majesty सुल्तान हैथम ने आगे बढ़ाया। वे जिस प्रकार यहां भारतीयों का सहयोग करते हैं, संरक्षण देते हैं, इसके लिए मैं उनका विशेष तौर पर आभार व्यक्त करता हूं। साथियों, आप सभी परीक्षा पे चर्चा कार्यक्रम से भी परिचित हैं। यहां ओमान से काफी सारे बच्चे भी इस प्रोग्राम से जुड़ते हैं। मुझे यकीन है, कि यह चर्चा आपके काम आती होगी, पैरेंट्स हों या स्टूडेंट्स, सभी को stress-free तरीके से exam देने में हमारी बातचीत बहुत मदद करती है। साथियों, ओमान में रहने वाले भारतीय अक्सर भारत आते-जाते रहते हैं। आप भारत की हर घटना से अपडेट रहते हैं। आप सभी देख रहे हैं कि आज हमारा भारत कैसे प्रगति की नई गति से आगे बढ़ रहा है। भारत की गति हमारे इरादों में दिख रही है, हमारी परफॉर्मेंस में नज़र आती है। कुछ दिन पहले ही इकॉनॉमिक ग्रोथ के आंकड़े आए हैं, और आपको पता होगा, भारत की ग्रोथ 8 परसेंट से अधिक रही है। यानि भारत, लगातार दुनिया की Fastest growing major economy बना हुआ है। ये तब हुआ है, जब पूरी दुनिया चुनौतियों से घिरी हुई है। दुनिया की बड़ी-बड़ी economies, कुछ ही परसेंट ग्रोथ अचीव करने के लिए तरस गई हैं। लेकिन भारत लगातार हाई ग्रोथ के पथ पर चल रहा है। ये दिखाता है कि भारत का सामर्थ्य आज क्या है। साथियों, भारत आज हर सेक्टर में हर मोर्चे पर अभूतपूर्व गति के साथ काम कर रहा है। मैं आज आपको बीते 11 साल के आंकड़े देता हूं। आपको भी सुनकर गर्व होगा। यहां क्योंकि बहुत बड़ी संख्या में, स्टूडेंट्स और पेरेंट्स आए हैं, तो शुरुआत मैं शिक्षा और कौशल के सेक्टर से ही बात करुंगा। बीते 11 साल में भारत में हज़ारों नए कॉलेज बनाए गए हैं। I.I.T’s की संख्या सोलह से बढ़कर तेईस हो चुकी है। 11 वर्ष पहले भारत में 13 IIM थे, आज 21 हैं। इसी तरह AIIMs की बात करुं तो 2014 से पहले सिर्फ 7 एम्स ही बने थे। आज भारत में 22 एम्स हैं। मेडिकल कॉलेज 400 से भी कम थे, आज भारत में करीब 800 मेडिकल कॉलेज हैं। साथियों, आज हम विकसित भारत के लिए अपने एजुकेशन और स्किल इकोसिस्टम को तैयार कर रहे हैं। न्यू एजुकेशन पॉलिसी इसमें बहुत बड़ी भूमिका निभा रही है। इस पॉलिसी के मॉडल के रूप में चौदह हज़ार से अधिक पीएम श्री स्कूल भी खोले जा रहे हैं। साथियों, जब स्कूल बढ़ते हैं, कॉलेज बढ़ते हैं, यूनिवर्सिटीज़ बढ़ती हैं तो सिर्फ़ इमारतें नहीं बनतीं देश का भविष्य मज़बूत होता है। साथियों, भारत के विकास की स्पीड और स्केल शिक्षा के साथ ही अन्य क्षेत्रों में भी दिखती है। बीते 11 वर्षों में हमारी Solar Energy Installed Capacity 30 गुना बढ़ी है, Solar module manufacturing 10 गुना बढ़ी है, यानि भारत आज ग्रीन ग्रोथ की तरफ तेजी से कदम आगे बढ़ा रहा है। आज भारत दुनिया का सबसे बड़ा फिनटेक इकोसिस्टम है। दुनिया का दूसरा सबसे बड़ा Steel Producer है। दूसरा सबसे बड़ा Mobile Manufacturer है। साथियों, आज जो भी भारत आता है तो हमारे आधुनिक इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर को देखकर हैरान रह जाता है। ये इसलिए संभव हो पा रहा है क्योंकि बीते 11 वर्षों में हमने इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर पर पांच गुना अधिक निवेश किया है। Airports की संख्या double हो गई है। आज हर रोज, पहले की तुलना में डबल स्पीड से हाइवे बन रहे हैं, तेज़ गति से रेल लाइन बिछ रही हैं, रेलवे का इलेक्ट्रिफिकेशन हो रहा है। साथियों, ये आंकड़े सिर्फ उपलब्धियों के ही नहीं हैं। ये विकसित भारत के संकल्प तक पहुंचने वाली सीढ़ियां हैं। 21वीं सदी का भारत बड़े फैसले लेता है। तेज़ी से निर्णय लेता है, बड़े लक्ष्यों के साथ आगे बढ़ता है, और एक तय टाइमलाइन पर रिजल्ट लाकर ही दम लेता है। साथियों, मैं आपको गर्व की एक और बात बताता हूं। आज भारत, दुनिया का सबसे बड़ा digital public infrastructure बना रहा है। भारत का UPI यानि यूनिफाइड पेमेंट्स इंटरफेस, दुनिया का सबसे बड़ा रियल टाइम डिजिटल पेमेंट सिस्टम है। आपको ये बताने के लिए कि इस पेमेंट सिस्टम का स्केल क्या है, मैं एक छोटा सा Example देता हूं। मुझे यहाँ आ कर के करीब 30 मिनट्स हुए हैं। इन 30 मिनट में भारत में यूपीआई से फोर्टीन मिलियन रियल टाइम डिजिटल पेमेंट्स हुए हैं। इन ट्रांजैक्शन्स की टोटल वैल्यू, ट्वेंटी बिलियन रुपीज़ से ज्यादा है। भारत में बड़े से बड़े शोरूम से लेकर एक छोटे से वेंडर तक सब इस पेमेंट सिस्टम से जुड़े हुए हैं। साथियों, यहां इतने सारे स्टूडेंट्स हैं। मैं आपको एक और दिलचस्प उदाहरण दूंगा। भारत ने डिजीलॉकर की आधुनिक व्यवस्था बनाई है। भारत में बोर्ड के एग्ज़ाम होते हैं, तो मार्कशीट सीधे बच्चों के डिजीलॉकर अकाउंट में आती है। जन्म से लेकर बुढ़ापे तक, जो भी डॉक्युमेंट सरकार जेनरेट करती है, वो डिजीलॉकर में रखा जा सकता है। ऐसे बहुत सारे डिजिटल सिस्टम आज भारत में ease of living सुनिश्चित कर रहे हैं। साथियों, भारत के चंद्रयान का कमाल भी आप सभी ने देखा है। भारत दुनिया का पहला ऐसा देश है, जो मून के साउथ पोल तक पहुंचा है, सिर्फ इतना ही नहीं, हमने एक बार में 104 सैटेलाइट्स को एक साथ लॉन्च करने का कीर्तिमान भी बनाया है। अब भारत अपने गगनयान से पहला ह्युमेन स्पेस मिशन भी भेजने जा रहा है। और वो समय भी दूर नहीं जब अंतरिक्ष में भारत का अपना खुद का स्पेस स्टेशन भी होगा। साथियों, भारत का स्पेस प्रोग्राम सिर्फ अपने तक सीमित नहीं है, हम ओमान की स्पेस एस्पिरेशन्स को भी सपोर्ट कर रहे हैं। 6-7 साल पहले हमने space cooperation को लेकर एक समझौता किया था। मुझे बताते हुए खुशी है कि, ISRO ने India–Oman Space Portal विकसित किया है। अब हमारा प्रयास है कि ओमान के युवाओं को भी इस स्पेस पार्टनरशिप का लाभ मिले। मैं यहां बैठे स्टूडेंट्स को एक और जानकारी दूंगा। इसरो, ""YUVIKA” नाम से एक स्पेशल प्रोग्राम चलाता है। इसमें भारत के हज़ारों स्टूडेंट्स space science से जुड़े हैं। अब हमारा प्रयास है कि इस प्रोग्राम में ओमानी स्टूडेंट्स को भी मौका मिले। मैं चाहूंगा कि ओमान के कुछ स्टूडेंट्स, बैंगलुरु में ISRO के सेंटर में आएं, वहां कुछ समय गुज़ारें। ये ओमान के युवाओं की स्पेस एस्पिरेशन्स को नई बुलंदी देने की बेहतरीन शुरुआत हो सकती है। साथियों, आज भारत, अपनी समस्याओं के सोल्यूशन्स तो खोज ही रहा है ये सॉल्यूशन्स दुनिया के करोड़ों लोगों का जीवन कैसे बेहतर बना सकते हैं इस पर भी काम कर रहा है। software development से लेकर payroll management तक, data analysis से लेकर customer support तक अनेक global brands भारत के टैलेंट की ताकत से आगे बढ़ रहे हैं। दशकों से भारत IT और IT-enabled services का global powerhouse रहा है। अब हम manufacturing को IT की ताक़त के साथ जोड़ रहे हैं। और इसके पीछे की सोच वसुधैव कुटुंबकम से ही प्रेरित है। यानि Make in India, Make for the World. साथियों, वैक्सीन्स हों या जेनरिक medicines, दुनिया हमें फार्मेसी of the World कहती है। यानि भारत के affordable और क्वालिटी हेल्थकेयर सोल्यूशन्स दुनिया के करोड़ों लोगों का जीवन बचा रहे हैं। कोविड के दौरान भारत ने करीब 30 करोड़ vaccines दुनिया को भेजी थीं। मुझे संतोष है कि करीब, one hundred thousand मेड इन इंडिया कोविड वैक्सीन्स ओमान के लोगों के काम आ सकीं। और साथियों, याद कीजिए, ये काम भारत ने तब किया, जब हर कोई अपने बारे में सोच रहा था। तब हम दुनिया की चिंता करते थे। भारत ने अपने 140 करोड़ नागरिकों को भी रिकॉर्ड टाइम में वैक्सीन्स लगाईं, और दुनिया की ज़रूरतें भी पूरी कीं। ये भारत का मॉडल है, ऐसा मॉडल, जो twenty first century की दुनिया को नई उम्मीद देता है। इसलिए आज जब भारत मेड इन इंडिया Chips बना रहा है, AI, क्वांटम कंप्यूटिंग और ग्रीन हाइड्रोजन को लेकर मिशन मोड पर काम कर रहा है, तब दुनिया के अन्य देशों में भी उम्मीद जगती है, कि भारत की सफलता से उन्हें भी सहयोग मिलेगा। साथियों, आप यहां ओमान में पढ़ाई कर रहे हैं, यहां काम कर रहे हैं। आने वाले समय में आप ओमान के विकास में, भारत के विकास में बहुत बड़ी भूमिका निभाएंगे। आप दुनिया को लीडरशिप देने वाली पीढ़ी हैं। ओमान में रहने वाले भारतीयों को असुविधा न हो, इसके लिए यहां की सरकार हर संभव सहयोग दे रही है। भारत सरकार भी आपकी सुविधा का पूरा ध्यान रख रही है। पूरे ओमान में 11 काउंसलर सर्विस सेंटर्स खोले हैं। साथियों, बीते दशक में जितने भी वैश्विक संकट आए हैं, उनमें हमारी सरकार ने तेज़ी से भारतीयों की मदद की है। दुनिया में जहां भी भारतीय रहते हैं, हमारी सरकार कदम-कदम पर उनके साथ है। इसके लिए Indian Community Welfare Fund, मदद पोर्टल, और प्रवासी भारतीय बीमा योजना जैसे प्रयास किए गए हैं। साथियों, भारत के लिए ये पूरा क्षेत्र बहुत ही स्पेशल है, और ओमान हमारे लिए और भी विशेष है। मुझे खुशी है कि भारत-ओमान का रिश्ता अब skill development, digital learning, student exchange और entrepreneurship तक पहुंच रहा है। मुझे विश्वास है आपके बीच से ऐसे young innovators निकलेंगे जो आने वाले वर्षों में India–Oman relationship को नई ऊंचाई पर ले जाएंगे। अभी यहां भारतीय स्कूलों ने अपने 50 साल celebrate किए हैं। अब हमें अगले 50 साल के लक्ष्यों के साथ आगे बढ़ना है। इसलिए मैं हर youth से कहना चाहूंगा : Dream big.

                18 DEC 2025 3:20PM by PIB Delhi The Indian space programme enables space-based inputs to the nodal Ministries/Departments as well as to Central & State disaster management authorities, for effective disaster management and developing disaster resilience. The National Database for Emergency Management (NDEM, Version 5.0) developed by ISRO is part of the Integrated Control Room for Emergency Response (ICR-ER), of MHA, for emergency response decision support. Satellite data inputs are also used for generation of essential climate variables. Space technology is being used in the agriculture sector for crop production forecasting, crop surveillance, agro-met advisories, crop insurance programme, Krishi-DSS, etc. The contribution of India's space program to national priorities, particularly scientific research, is multi-faceted. Far beyond technological prestige, India's space science missions have fundamentally advanced the scientific knowledge base. These programs provide invaluable platforms for conducting research on space sciences. The knowledge thus acquired feeds directly into domestic research institutions and universities, nurturing specialized talent and fostering a robust ecosystem of scientific inquiry. By engaging in dedicated science missions, which are achieved through cost-effective, indigenous solutions, India establishes global credibility, and ensures that Indian scientists are at the forefront of space exploration, driving innovation and providing scientific and technological knowledge essential for National self-reliance. India’s Space program has contributed immensely for digital connectivity supporting telemedicine, tele-education, e-governance, broadband etc. India’s satellite navigation system, NavIC is providing position Navigation and timing services. India’s space sector is undergoing a phase of swift expansion which will be able to sustain mission reliability, cost-effectiveness, global competitiveness and responsible private sector participation. Institutional alignment within the space ecosystem is clearly delineated under Indian Space Policy 2023 and it is steadily maturing. All efforts to coordinate among stakeholders is being carried out by the department. Financial challenges remain limited because India has built a highly cost-efficient programme, and new funding channels for private space ecosystem ensure that growth needs are adequately met. Technological gaps are narrowing rapidly as ISRO’s sustained R&D, indigenous manufacturing capabilities and strong industry partnerships continue to deliver reliable, world-class systems. Commercial barriers are modest, with India’s proven mission success rate and expanding global demand giving Indian industry a natural competitive edge. Private-sector participation is progressing responsibly, supported by clear standards, mature regulatory mechanisms and hand-holding by ISRO that minimise risks. Long-term vision of societal access to space-based services are achievable, given India’s established satellite infrastructure and ongoing augmentation plans. The outlook for commercial growth is strong, with India’s inherent cost advantage and emerging private-sector capabilities. IN-SPACe has brought out the Decadal Vision and Strategy for India’s Space economy, with mission to realize $44 Billion market potential in Space for India, including $11 Billion in exports, and create an ecosystem where private, public and start-up collaborate in whole-of-nation approach. IN-SPACe has catalysed the capabilities such as i) Demand generation, ii) EO Platform, iii) Communication Platform, iv) Navigation Platform, v) Research and Development, vi) Creation of Talent Pool, vii) Access to Finance and viii) International Synergy and Collaboration”, to promote exports of hardware, space-based data services, and satellite products globally. International cooperation continues to expand smoothly, with India already regarded as a reliable, neutral and capable partner in both science and space collaboration. India also has successfully accomplished major collaborative mission-NISAR. Bharatiya Antariksh Station (BAS) will provide a platform for further deepening the international collaborations with other major countries. Strategic autonomy is well within reach, as ISRO’s technology roadmap covers critical domains, from launch vehicles to satellites, ensuring minimal external dependence. Space-based capabilities will continue to integrate deeply into national development priorities, given the proven success of remote sensing, meteorology, and NAVIC application in governance. A major step in this direction is Geospatial Governance, where tools like GIS maps and satellite-based Earth observation are used to improve public services. To further strengthen this effort, the Department of Space organised the National Meet 2025 on August 22, 2025, which brought together many Ministries and Government departments. These interactions helped identify each sector’s specific data needs. This helps ISRO provide more accurate and timely information so that government decisions are better informed and development becomes faster and more transparent. Inclusivity is inherently built into India’s space programme, with most datasets and services already reaching farmers, disaster managers and grassroots planners with minimal barriers. ISRO’s globally recognised cost-efficiency ensures that space-based applications remain accessible even as capabilities expand. The ecosystem is naturally inclusive, with MSMEs and start-ups are already involved in significant portions of the supply chain and benefiting from open procurement frameworks. ISRO’s mission planning consistently prioritises public welfare, ensuring that new capabilities directly support national development and remain aligned with citizens’ needs. M/s.

                18 DEC 2025 3:10PM by PIB Delhi Nuclear wastes generated at the nuclear power stations during their operation and maintenance are low and intermediate activity level waste and are managed at the site itself. These wastes are treated, concentrated, compacted, immobilized in solid materials like cement and disposed/stored in specially constructed structures such as reinforced concrete trenches/tile holes, located at the site. Further, nearly closed nuclear fuel cycle is being followed in India, where spent fuels from domestic sources are reprocessed to reduce the waste burden and recover the useful element for recycle/reuse. The fissile element recovered from reprocessing of spent fuel is recycled back as a fuel for future reactors. High-level radioactive waste generated during reprocessing is then immobilized into an inert glass matrix by vitrification and stored in Solid Storage Surveillance Facilities for interim storage at par with international practices as per the guidelines of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). A well-established nuclear waste management system is in place at all the nuclear power plant sites. India has adopted “nearly closed fuel cycle”, where spent nuclear fuel is regarded as a material of resource. The closed fuel cycle aims at reprocessing of spent fuel for recovery of fissile materials and utilization as fuel. This finally leads to a very small percentage of residual material present in spent nuclear fuel requiring their management as nuclear waste. The current capacities of Near Surface Disposal Facilities (NSDF) at existing sites are adequate to store the waste generated at Nuclear Power Plants. Research and development are being done for new technologies for waste management on partitioning technologies for segregation of long-lived radioactive constituents including actinides, and extraction of useful radioisotopes for societal application as well as waste volume reduction.

                        18 DEC 2025 3:10PM by PIB Delhi Nuclear wastes generated at the nuclear power stations during their operation and maintenance are low and intermediate activity level waste and are managed at the site itself. These wastes are treated, concentrated, compacted, immobilized in solid materials like cement and disposed/stored in specially constructed structures such as reinforced concrete trenches/tile holes, located at the site. Further, nearly closed nuclear fuel cycle is being followed in India, where spent fuels from domestic sources are reprocessed to reduce the waste burden and recover the useful element for recycle/reuse. The fissile element recovered from reprocessing of spent fuel is recycled back as a fuel for future reactors. High-level radioactive waste generated during reprocessing is then immobilized into an inert glass matrix by vitrification and stored in Solid Storage Surveillance Facilities for interim storage at par with international practices as per the guidelines of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). A well-established nuclear waste management system is in place at all the nuclear power plant sites. India has adopted “nearly closed fuel cycle”, where spent nuclear fuel is regarded as a material of resource. The closed fuel cycle aims at reprocessing of spent fuel for recovery of fissile materials and utilization as fuel. This finally leads to a very small percentage of residual material present in spent nuclear fuel requiring their management as nuclear waste. The current capacities of Near Surface Disposal Facilities (NSDF) at existing sites are adequate to store the waste generated at Nuclear Power Plants. Research and development are being done for new technologies for waste management on partitioning technologies for segregation of long-lived radioactive constituents including actinides, and extraction of useful radioisotopes for societal application as well as waste volume reduction. The practice of storage and disposal of radioactive waste is at par with international practices following the guidelines of International Atomic Energy Agency. Till date, the surveillance of the disposal areas at different sites has confirmed high degree of effectiveness of the disposal system for the containment of disposed wastes. There has been no incident of release of radioactivity from such disposed wastes.

                18 DEC 2025 3:09PM by PIB Delhi The Government has drawn up a comprehensive road map to reach a capacity of about 100 GW by 2047. The present nuclear power capacity is planned to be increased to about 22 GW by 2031-32 on progressive completion of projects under implementation. Further, NPCIL has drawn up plans to contribute about 54 GW out of the 100 GW capacity envisioned by 2047. India has limited uranium and abundant thorium reserves. Thorium unlike uranium, is a fertile material and need to be converted to fissile uranium-233 in a nuclear reactor, before it can be used to generate energy by nuclear fission. Realising this, the Three- Stage Nuclear Power Programme envisaged by the Department remains a key component of the India’s nuclear power programme aiming towards optimum utilisation of limited uranium resources and exploitation of abundant thorium reserves for long term energy security in sustainable manner. The Three-Stage Nuclear Power Programme aims to multiply the domestically available fissile resource through the use of natural uranium in Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs), followed by use of plutonium, obtained from the spent fuel of PHWRs, in Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs). Large scale utilisation of thorium will subsequently follow, making use of fissile uranium-233 bred from thorium in a breeder reactor fuelled using plutonium, only after adequate installed capacity of FBRs has been achieved. BHAVINI is currently commissioning a 500 MWe Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) project at Kalpakkam, Tamil Nadu. Government has accorded approval to carry out pre-project activities for 2 x 500 MWe twin unit of FBR 1&2 project at Kalpakkam, Tamil Nadu. Environmental and social impact assessment study as per the applicable norms will be carried out for these projects.

                18 DEC 2025 12:56PM by PIB Delhi “India’s high-impact, short-duration operational capability was demonstrated during by the Armed Forces during Operation Sindoor,” said Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh, as he described the Indian Air Force (IAF) as a technologically advanced, operationally agile, strategically confident and future-oriented force which is safeguarding national interests amidst the constantly-evolving global order. He was addressing the Air Force Commanders’ Conclave in New Delhi on December 18, 2025. Raksha Mantri praised the courage, speed & precision with which the IAF destroyed the terror camps during the operation, and effectively handling the “irresponsible reaction” from Pakistan after the strikes. Highlighting the people’s trust in the Armed Forces, especially the air defence capability, he said “Usually, when enemy attacks, people hide. But, when the Pakistani forces tried to target Indian installations, the people of India remained calm and continued with their daily routines. This is the proof of the trust of every Indian in our operational preparedness”. Underscoring the importance of thoroughly understanding the enemy’s offensive and defensive capabilities to maintain a decisive advantage, he urged the Commanders to take lessons from Operation Sindoor, and stay vigilant and ready to deal with every future challenge. Reflecting on the changing nature of warfare, Shri Rajnath Singh stated that the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Israel-Hamas war, Balakot air strikes and Operation Sindoor are proof that air power has emerged as a decisive force in today’s times. He stressed that air power is not just a tactical asset, but a strategic instrument, and speed, surprise & shock effect are its inherent characteristics. “Air power gives any leadership the capability to deliver a clear strategic message to the adversary that every step will be taken to uphold national interests. Through speed, reach, and precision, air power has become an effective tool for aligning the nation’s objectives with military means,” he added. While Raksha Mantri commended the performance of India’s air defence system and other equipment effectively used during Operation Sindoor , he reiterated Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi-led Government’s commitment to further strengthening the security apparatus of the country. “21 st century warfare is not just a war of weapons. It is a war of ideas, technology, and adaptability. Cyber warfare, Artificial Intelligence, unmanned aerial vehicles, satellite-based surveillance, and space-enabled capabilities are fundamentally changing the future of warfare. Precision-guided weapons, real-time intelligence, and data-driven decision-making are no longer optional; they have become basic requirements for success in modern conflicts. Those nations which master the trinity of technology, strategic vision, and adaptability will move towards global leadership,” he added. Shri Rajnath Singh exuded confidence that Sudarshan Chakra, which was announced by PM Modi during his Independence Day speech this year, will play a crucial role in protecting national assets in the coming times. He added that the development of indigenous jet engines has become a national mission, and the Government is fully committed to achieving this objective. Raksha Mantri pointed out that the Government is working in collaboration with the private sector, including start-ups & MSMEs, to further the modernisation of the Armed Forces, inviting young minds into defence manufacturing through initiatives such as iDEX and ADITI. He informed that, as on November 2025, out of the 565 challenges given under iDEX, a total of 672 winners have emerged, including 96 winners from the 77 challenges related to the IAF. This achievement demonstrates that the interest of young people, especially from the private sector, is growing rapidly in the defence sector, he said. Describing Operation Sindoor as a shining example of Tri-service synergy, Shri Rajnath Singh underlined the importance of jointness in today’s rapidly changing times. “Jointness among the three Services is crucial as it would further strengthen our security system, and enable us to deal with our adversaries even more effectively,” he said. Raksha Mantri lauded the IAF for their Humanitarian Assistance & Disaster Relief efforts, both domestically and internationally. “Whether at home or abroad, IAF has consistently provided critical support during natural calamities. Many of the missions were executed in extremely challenging situations which has increased the trust of the people in our air warriors,” he said. The conclave was attended by the Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan and senior commanders of IAF. Upon his arrival, Raksha Mantri was received by the Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal AP Singh, and was subsequently briefed on the IAF’s operational readiness. The conclave provides a strategic platform for IAF leadership to deliberate on operational priorities, address emerging challenges and advance Aatmanirbharta in defence  capabilities, steering the force towards excellence. *** VK/Savvy (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205755) आगंतुक पटल  : 331 इस विज्ञप्ति को इन भाषाओं में पढ़ें: Urdu , Tamil Ministry of Defence Operation Sindoor demonstrated India’s high-impact, short-duration operational capability: Raksha Mantri at Air Force Commanders’ Conclave “IAF is a technologically advanced, operationally agile, strategically confident & future-oriented force, safeguarding national interests in today’s times” Shri Rajnath Singh urges Commanders to take lessons from Operation Sindoor, and stay ready to deal with every future challenge “21st century warfare is not just a war of weapons, it is a war of ideas, technology & adaptability; Govt is commitment to further strengthening security apparatus” प्रविष्टि तिथि:

Underscoring the importance of thoroughly understanding the enemy’s offensive and defensive capabilities to maintain a decisive advantage, he urged the Commanders to take lessons from Operation Sindoor, and stay vigilant and ready to deal with every future challenge. Reflecting on the changing nature of warfare, Shri Rajnath Singh stated that the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Israel-Hamas war, Balakot air strikes and Operation Sindoor are proof that air power has emerged as a decisive force in today’s times. He stressed that air power is not just a tactical asset, but a strategic instrument, and speed, surprise & shock effect are its inherent characteristics. “Air power gives any leadership the capability to deliver a clear strategic message to the adversary that every step will be taken to uphold national interests. Through speed, reach, and precision, air power has become an effective tool for aligning the nation’s objectives with military means,” he added. While Raksha Mantri commended the performance of India’s air defence system and other equipment effectively used during Operation Sindoor , he reiterated Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi-led Government’s commitment to further strengthening the security apparatus of the country. “21 st century warfare is not just a war of weapons. It is a war of ideas, technology, and adaptability. Cyber warfare, Artificial Intelligence, unmanned aerial vehicles, satellite-based surveillance, and space-enabled capabilities are fundamentally changing the future of warfare. Precision-guided weapons, real-time intelligence, and data-driven decision-making are no longer optional; they have become basic requirements for success in modern conflicts. Those nations which master the trinity of technology, strategic vision, and adaptability will move towards global leadership,” he added. Shri Rajnath Singh exuded confidence that Sudarshan Chakra, which was announced by PM Modi during his Independence Day speech this year, will play a crucial role in protecting national assets in the coming times. He added that the development of indigenous jet engines has become a national mission, and the Government is fully committed to achieving this objective. Raksha Mantri pointed out that the Government is working in collaboration with the private sector, including start-ups & MSMEs, to further the modernisation of the Armed Forces, inviting young minds into defence manufacturing through initiatives such as iDEX and ADITI. He informed that, as on November 2025, out of the 565 challenges given under iDEX, a total of 672 winners have emerged, including 96 winners from the 77 challenges related to the IAF. This achievement demonstrates that the interest of young people, especially from the private sector, is growing rapidly in the defence sector, he said. Describing Operation Sindoor as a shining example of Tri-service synergy, Shri Rajnath Singh underlined the importance of jointness in today’s rapidly changing times. “Jointness among the three Services is crucial as it would further strengthen our security system, and enable us to deal with our adversaries even more effectively,” he said. Raksha Mantri lauded the IAF for their Humanitarian Assistance & Disaster Relief efforts, both domestically and internationally. “Whether at home or abroad, IAF has consistently provided critical support during natural calamities. Many of the missions were executed in extremely challenging situations which has increased the trust of the people in our air warriors,” he said. The conclave was attended by the Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan and senior commanders of IAF. Upon his arrival, Raksha Mantri was received by the Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal AP Singh, and was subsequently briefed on the IAF’s operational readiness. The conclave provides a strategic platform for IAF leadership to deliberate on operational priorities, address emerging challenges and advance Aatmanirbharta in defence  capabilities, steering the force towards excellence. *** VK/Savvy (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205755)","2025-12-18T10:09:41.374447"

                18 DEC 2025 2:45PM by PIB Delhi Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC), Government of India has published the Battery Waste Management Rules, 2022 on 24 th August, 2022 for environmentally sound management of waste batteries. These rules cover all types of batteries viz. Electric Vehicle batteries, portable batteries, automotive batteries and industrial batteries. The rules are based on the concept of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) where the producers, including importers, of batteries have been given annual targets for collection and recycling or refurbishment of waste batteries against the batteries placed in the market. The rules mandate producers to use minimum percentage of domestically recycled materials in manufacturing of new batteries from FY 2027-28 onwards. Centralized online EPR portal has been developed for registration of producers and recyclers/ refurbishers, exchange of EPR certificates between producers and recyclers/ refurbishers and filing returns by producers and recyclers/ refurbishers. So far, 4022 producers and 487 recyclers have been registered under these rules on the EPR portal. After the notification of these rules, around 58.26 lakh tonnes of battery waste has been recycled . EPR mechanism under Battery Waste Management Rules, 2022 recognise only EPR certificates generated by registered recyclers. The EPR mechanism encourages formalisation of informal sector to generate revenues from exchange of EPR certificates with producers, in addition to the revenue generated from sale of recycled materials. To upgrade informal sector into formal value chain, a project on ‘Informal Sector Capacity Building Upgradation with formation of recycling clusters under the Scheme ‘Micro & Small Enterprises Cluster Development (MSE-CDP) of MSME’ has been initiated by MeitY. MeitY has transferred the cost-effective Li-ion battery recycling technology indigenously developed by Centre for Material for Electronics Technology (C-MET) to several recycling industries and start-ups as part of Mission LiFE under ‘Promote circularity campaign’. The Government has approved the PLI-ACC scheme ‘National Programme on Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery Storage’ in May 2021, with an outlay of Rs. 18,100 Crore for 50 GWh ACC capacity. This initiative has acted as a catalyst for Indian cell manufacturers to setup a cell manufacturing unit. Apart from the PLI beneficiaries, more than 10 companies have announced setting up cell manufacturing unit for more than 100 GWh additional capacity. Ministry of Mines has launched the scheme ‘Critical Mineral Recycling Incentive Scheme’ aimed at developing the recycling capacity in the country for extraction of critical minerals from secondary sources such as E-waste, spent Lithium-ion Batteries (LiBs), and other scrap. Further, MoEF&CC facilitated the signing of Memorandum of Understanding between CSIR laboratories, like National Metallurgical Laboratory (NML), Advanced Materials and Processes Research Institute (AMPRI) and Central Electrochemical Research Institute (CECRI), and recycler organisations, to facilitate technology transfer and technical support to establish state-of-the-art recycling infrastructure, support domestic waste recycling, and secure critical mineral supplies through advanced recycling processes.

So far, 4022 producers and 487 recyclers have been registered under these rules on the EPR portal. After the notification of these rules, around 58.26 lakh tonnes of battery waste has been recycled . EPR mechanism under Battery Waste Management Rules, 2022 recognise only EPR certificates generated by registered recyclers. The EPR mechanism encourages formalisation of informal sector to generate revenues from exchange of EPR certificates with producers, in addition to the revenue generated from sale of recycled materials. To upgrade informal sector into formal value chain, a project on ‘Informal Sector Capacity Building Upgradation with formation of recycling clusters under the Scheme ‘Micro & Small Enterprises Cluster Development (MSE-CDP) of MSME’ has been initiated by MeitY. MeitY has transferred the cost-effective Li-ion battery recycling technology indigenously developed by Centre for Material for Electronics Technology (C-MET) to several recycling industries and start-ups as part of Mission LiFE under ‘Promote circularity campaign’. The Government has approved the PLI-ACC scheme ‘National Programme on Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery Storage’ in May 2021, with an outlay of Rs. 18,100 Crore for 50 GWh ACC capacity. This initiative has acted as a catalyst for Indian cell manufacturers to setup a cell manufacturing unit. Apart from the PLI beneficiaries, more than 10 companies have announced setting up cell manufacturing unit for more than 100 GWh additional capacity. Ministry of Mines has launched the scheme ‘Critical Mineral Recycling Incentive Scheme’ aimed at developing the recycling capacity in the country for extraction of critical minerals from secondary sources such as E-waste, spent Lithium-ion Batteries (LiBs), and other scrap. Further, MoEF&CC facilitated the signing of Memorandum of Understanding between CSIR laboratories, like National Metallurgical Laboratory (NML), Advanced Materials and Processes Research Institute (AMPRI) and Central Electrochemical Research Institute (CECRI), and recycler organisations, to facilitate technology transfer and technical support to establish state-of-the-art recycling infrastructure, support domestic waste recycling, and secure critical mineral supplies through advanced recycling processes.

In addition, 02 states (Uttar Pradesh and Tripura) have reported to have made recovery from contractors on account of liquidated damages, while 02 states (Karnataka and Tripura) on account of forfeiture of EMD/ FDR. The state-wise details of penalties imposed and recoveries made are annexed. Uttar Pradesh has reported that it initiated enquiries in 14,264 complaints received from various channels including suo moto cognizance. The report has been submitted in 14,212 cases while the enquiry is under process in 52 cases. The state has further reported that against these complaints, action was taken in 434 cases which involves 171 Department level officials, 120 contractors and 143 TPIAs, while remaining complaints have either been addressed or found irrelevant. As reported by the Government of Gujarat, a financial loss of Rs. 120.65 crore has occurred due to irregularities in 620 villages of Mahisagar district, and orders have been issued for recovery from 112 implementing agencies. The State Government has reported that Rs. 6.65 crore has been recovered from these agencies so far. Further, all 112 agencies have been debarred by the State Government, and an FIR was registered in the matter. The case is presently under investigation by the CID Crime Branch, and so far, 9 officials/contractors have been arrested. Since August 2019, Government of India is implementing JJM, in partnership with States/ UTs, to make provision of safe and adequate tap water connection to every rural household of the country. ‘Drinking Water’ is a state subject, and hence, the responsibility of planning, approval, implementation, operation & maintenance of drinking water supply schemes, including those under the JJM, lies with State/UT Governments. The Government of India supports the states by providing technical and financial assistance. At the start of JJM in August 2019, only 3.23 crore (16.7%) rural households were reported to have tap water connections. So far, as reported by States/ UTs as on 11.12.2025, around 12.52 crore additional rural households have been provided with tap water connections under JJM. Thus, as on 11.12.2025, out of 19.36 crore rural households in the country, more than 15.76 crore (81.41%) rural households are reported to have tap water connection. To support states in effective planning and implementation of JJM, detailed operational guidelines covering all aspects of planning, execution, quality assurance, monitoring, and sustainability of infrastructure created under JJM has been shared with States/ UTs. Government of India has also been regularly reviewing the implementation with respective state governments through review meetings and visits of multi-disciplinary teams to highlight the areas to strengthen implementation and monitoring for expeditious implementation of the mission. Under JJM, technology is utilized to ensure transparency and accountability. Physical and financial progress is reported on JJM–Integrated Management Information Systems (IMIS) and all tap water connections provided, are to be linked with Aadhar number of the head of the household. Provisions have also been made for geo-tagging of assets created under the JJM. To ensure the quality of the work under the operational guidelines for the implementation of the JJM, third party inspection and certification before payment is mandatory. For the purpose, States/UTs have been empowered to empanel third party inspection agencies (TPIA) to check the quality of work executed by the agencies, quality of materials used for construction and quality of machinery installed in each of the scheme. Any deviation from prescribed JJM guidelines is required to be acted upon by the State/UT Government concerned. As per the data reported by 32 States/ UTs, action has been taken against 621 Departmental Officials, 969 contractors and 153 Third Party Inspection Agencies in cases of financial irregularities and poor quality of works under JJM. The departmental officials involved in irregularities are undergoing administrative action, including suspension, departmental inquries, issuance of charge sheets as per established procedures. In the case of contractors, actions taken include blacklisting or recommendation for blacklisting, termination of contracts, debarment, forfeiture of earnest money deposits and imposition of penalties, depending on the nature of violation.  With regard to TPIAs, the concerned officials have been removed from empanelment, and in other cases, show-cause notices have been issued and recoveries initiated. Furthermore, States/ UTs have been repeatedly advised to adopt a zero-tolerance approach toward any financial, procedural, or quality-related violations. All States/ UTs have been advised to ensure that every complaint is duly examined, field verification is carried out promptly, and all required disciplinary, contractual, and legal actions are taken without exception to uphold transparency and accountability of the mission.

To meet the rising aspirations of people living in villages, Jal Jeevan Mission was conceptualized in consultation with the States in 2019 to make provision of tap water connection in every rural household across the country by restructuring and subsuming erstwhile National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP). As the programme was to be implemented by states, it was difficult at the EFC stage to know the exact number of schemes to be funded and the corresponding cost. On the basis of cost analysis done across all sample States, total cost was estimated to be about Rs. 7.88 lakh Crore whereas, by incentivizing States, the Central and State total funding envelope was estimated at Rs. 3.6 lakh Crore. Accordingly, Expenditure Finance Committee concurred restructuring and subsuming of erstwhile NRDWP for providing “ Functional Household Tap Connection (FHTC)” to every rural household by 2024 under JJM with an estimated cost of Rs. 3.60 lakh Crore for Har Ghar Nal Se Jal under Jal Jeevan Mission. In line with the recommendation of EFC, Government of India, approved implementation of Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) with an estimated cost of Rs. 3.60 lakh Crore out of which Central share was Rs. 2.08 lakh Crore . Almost entire Central share approved under the Mission has been utilized. Considering the progress achieved so far and ongoing works, Hon'ble Finance Minister during her budget speech 2025- 26 has announced extension of Jal Jeevan Mission until 2028 with an enhanced total outlay.

                18 DEC 2025 2:06PM by PIB Delhi The Government of India is taking sustained measures to strengthen the functioning and audience reach of Doordarshan and Akashvani in an increasingly competitive broadcasting environment. To improve content quality and variety, a simplified Content Sourcing Policy was introduced in 2024 to enable wider participation and faster acquisition of programmes. New programmes are launched regularly and local artists are engaged by Regional and State Centres to produce content in regional languages. Artist and Casual Assignee rates have also been revised to attract better talent and ultimately support quality local content across 66 Programme Production Centres of Doordarshan. Live coverage of major national events is regularly undertaken to ensure wide public outreach. Some of the examples include Mahakumbh 2025 (Prayagraj), WAVES 2025 (Mumbai) and ISRO satellite launches. Technological upgradation includes telecast of several DD channels in High Definition (HD), and strengthening digital presence through the launch of the OTT platform “WAVES”. DD and other channels are integrated on WAVES OTT, Online NewsONAIR Mobile app, etc. Akashvani has also launched audio-visual podcast series, namely “The Akashvani Podcast” and “Akashvani Originals”. Structural reforms have been carried out at Akashvani, including defined roles for Cluster Heads/Heads of Offices, focus on revenue generation, content improvement and market outreach. Alternative broadcasting modes such as apps, OTT and social media are being leveraged, supported by cross-channel publicity and coordinated marketing efforts. Modernization and upgradation of Prasar Bharati are being undertaken under the Broadcasting Infrastructure and Network Development (BIND) Scheme (2021-26) with an outlay of ₹2,539.61 crore. It focuses on digitalization, replacement of legacy systems, studio and transmitter upgradation, coverage expansion and adoption of new technologies. Measures to further enhance revenue also include improved client engagement, revenue-oriented content planning, multi-platform promotion and integrated advertising strategies. The total revenue generated by Akashvani and Doordarshan from the non-Government advertisement segment during 2022–25 stood at ₹587.78 crore.

A nationwide awareness campaign has been initiated to inform employers about the benefits and provisions of the scheme. Simultaneously, the matter has been taken up with various Government authorities to ensure the enrolment of contractual and casual employees under the EPF framework. The EEC–2025 provides a special compliance window of six months starting from November 2025 enabling employers to voluntarily enrol eligible employees who were left out of EPF coverage during the period from 1 July 2017 to 31 October 2025, and to regularize past non-compliance. Establishments not covered so far under the EPF Act may apply for coverage under this Campaign and subsequently declare and enrol such eligible employees. Under EES–2025, in cases where employees’ contributions were not deducted earlier, the employer shall be required to deposit only the employer’s share of contributions, along with interest under Section 7Q, applicable administrative charges, and penal damages limited to a lump sum of ₹100, which shall be treated as full compliance under all three schemes under EPFO. Establishments facing assessment inquiry are also eligible under the Scheme. Similarly, benefits under Pradhan Mantri Viksit Bharat Rojgar Yojana are also eligible subject to terms and conditions under the scheme. The EPFO has urged all employers to take advantage of this one-time, time-bound opportunity and contribute towards the national vision of “Social Security for All”. For this purpose, EPFO will communicate with identified defaulting employers through SMS and email, encouraging them to avail themselves of the EES 2025 one-time relaxation to regularise their defaults. *** Rini Choudhury (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205749) आगंतुक पटल  : 151 इस विज्ञप्ति को इन भाषाओं में पढ़ें: Urdu , हिन्दी Ministry of Labour & Employment EPFO urges Employers including State and Local Government Authorities to avail of the Employee Enrolment Scheme-2025 प्रविष्टि तिथि:

                18 DEC 2025 1:41PM by PIB Delhi The disposal of cases is within the exclusive domain of the judiciary.  In April, 2024, the Supreme Court Committee on ""Model Case Flow Management Rules for Trial Courts, District Appellate Courts, High Courts and to suggest a plan for reduction of arrears in the High Courts and District Courts"", prepared and shared an ‘Action Plan for Arrears Reduction in District Judiciary’ to dispose of old pending cases in time bound manner. The Action Plan inter-alia, indicated focusing upon prioritization of long- standing cases with special emphasis on cases pending for excessively long periods, such as over 10, 20 or 30 years; accelerating the progression of long standing and newer cases to finalization; equitable case distribution among judges; effective handling of unready and stayed cases; effective utilization of alternative dispute resolution; use of technology; managing undated cases for facilitating timely progression and resolution; adequate human resources support to Judicial Officers; regular monitoring of case progress and regular review meetings to assess effectiveness of action plan; stakeholder engagement to address procedural delays; and tailored strategies allowing for flexibility and adaptation of action plan to meet the specific circumstances of each district. Further, the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) has been upgraded with an improved dashboard for functioning as a monitoring tool to identify, manage and reduce pendency of cases. It provides timely inputs for making policy decisions to reduce case pendency. It also facilitates better monitoring of court performance and identification of systemic bottlenecks for efficient resource management. The Central Government is committed for speedy disposal of cases and reducing pendency as mandated under Article 21 of the Constitution and has taken several initiatives to provide an ecosystem for faster disposal of cases by the judiciary which includes, inter-alia,  amalgamation of latest technologies for increasing access to Justice and greater transparency under the e-Courts Mission Mode Project and supplementing of the resources of the State Governments/UTs for providing suitable infrastructure facilities for the District and Subordinate Judiciary under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme for Development of Infrastructure Facilities for Judiciary. The 14th Finance Commission had recommended the setting up of 1800 Fast Track Courts (FTCs) during the period 2015-2020 for expeditious trial of specific categories of cases including heinous crimes, civil cases involving women, children, senior citizens, persons with disabilities, individuals afflicted with terminal illnesses. As per information received from the High Courts, 866 FTCs are functional across 21 State/UTs as on 31.10.2025.

Udyam Registration Portal for MSMEs, for Ease of Doing Business, launched w.e.f. 01.07.2020. Inclusion of Retail and Wholesale traders as MSMEs w.e.f. 02.07.2021. Non-tax benefits extended for 3 years in case of an upward change in status of MSMEs. Launch of Udyam Assist platform on 11.01.2023 to bring Informal Micro Enterprises under the formal ambit for availing the benefit under Priority Sector Landing. Operationalisation of Self Reliant India Fund for equity infusion into MSMEs. Under Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS) for Micro and Small Enterprises, guarantee is provided to Member Lending Institutions for the credit extended by them to MSEs without any collateral security or third-party guarantee. Additional corpus fund of Rs. 9,000 crore was infused into the corpus of Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) , as announced in the Union Budget 2023-24 to enable an additional credit of Rs. 2.00 lakh crore, at a reduced cost of credit. Launch of Rs. 5 lakh crore Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS), for businesses, including MSMEs. The Scheme was operational till 31.03.2023. As per a research report dated 23.01.2023 of the State Bank of India on ECLGS, almost 14.6 lakh MSME accounts, of which about 98.3% of the accounts were in the Micro and Small Enterprises categories, were saved from slipping into non-performing asset classification. To provide relief and support to MSMEs in post Corona period, Vivad se Vishwas I - Relief for MSMEs (VsV-I) Scheme was launched by Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance, Government of India on 11.04.2023. Under the Scheme, relief by way of refund of 95% of the deducted performance security, bid security and liquidated damages was provided for Government contracts entered during COVID 19 period. Relief was also provided to MSMEs debarred for default in execution of contracts. More than 60,000 claims of MSMEs vendors were finalised under the scheme. In addition, the delivery period was extended for all contracts, including PPP contracts by 3 to 6 months without any penalty. For smooth implementation of the public Procurement Policy for Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) Order, 2012, a number of steps have been taken by the Ministry of MSME, as outlined below: The Ministry of MSME launched “MSME-SAMBANDH Portal” on 8th December, 2017. The Portal helps in actively monitoring the procurement by Central Government Ministries, Departments and Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs). The Ministry of MSME is actively engaged with Department of Public Enterprises, Ministry of Finance for better coordination with CPSEs for achieving the targets under the Policy. The Ministry of MSME also issues communications and clarifications on the Public Procurement Policy for MSEs, whenever required or asked for. Government e Marketplace (GeM), an online portal, is being used for procurement by Ministries/ Departments/ CPSEs. Follow up with GeM for supporting SC/ST and Women entrepreneurs is done on a regular basis. (iv) Vendor Development Programmes under the Procurement and Marketing Support Scheme serve as platform for MSEs, where MSEs can network with not only CPSEs but with also other stakeholders. Special Vendor Development Programmes/ Buyer-Seller Meets are being conducted by Departments/ CPSUs for SC/STs and women owned MSEs. Special Credit Linked Capital Subsidy Scheme (SCLCSS) under National SC-ST Hub Scheme promotes setting up of new enterprises by aspiring SC/ST entrepreneurs and their capacity building for enhanced participation in public procurement. This information was given by the Minister of State for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (Sushri Shobha Karandlaje) in a written reply in Lok Sabha today. ***** AKS (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205802)","2025-12-18T10:10:36.592619"

                18 DEC 2025 12:49PM by PIB Delhi The Ministry of Parliamentary Aﬀairs has transformed its functioning into a paperless ecosystem by fully leveraging seven key digital platforms: e-Office as the backbone for all file movement and approvals, e-HRMS for seamless handling of all service and HR matters, Consultative Committee Management System for end-to-end digital management of consultative committee meetings, Claims and Inventory Management System for transparent procurement and asset tracking, National e-Vidhan Application (NeVA) for legislative digital workflows in State/UT Legislatures, Online Assurance Monitoring System (OAMS) for real-time tracking of parliamentary assurances, and the dedicated National Youth Parliament Scheme portal. The direct benefits of this comprehensive digital adoptions are evident in the complete elimination of pendency (clearance of all references and files), drastic reduction in administrative delays like physical file movement and paper consumption, instantaneous visibility and audit trail of every transaction leading to unprecedented levels of transparency, fool-proof and easily retrievable electronic record-keeping, and a sharp drop in processing time. During Special Campaign 5.0 (2 nd – 31 st October 2025), the Ministry of Parliamentary Aﬀairs achieved “zero-pendency and zero-paper” by clearing 100% of pending references, conducting intensive cleanliness and waste-segregation drives, and promoting NeVA as a model of green governance that saves lakhs of trees annually. All officers and staff of the Ministry took the Swacchta pledge. Under Swachh Bharat, the Ministry aims for near-zero paper usage in all State/UT Legislatures through complete NeVA adoption and digitisation of legacy records. The Ministry’s future roadmap focuses on transforming NeVA for State/UT Legislatures into an AI-powered platform by integrating real-time multilingual machine translation capabilities (text-to-text, speech-to–text, text-to-speech and speech to speech) in various official languages for enabling users to access their content in their preferred regional language, generation of the House proceedings, AI-driven live transcription, searchable archives and intelligent multilingual chatbots. These features will drastically reduce printed material and enhance linguistic inclusivity.

                18 DEC 2025 11:59AM by PIB Delhi Key Takeaways The Viksit Bharat- G RAM G Bill, 2025 replaces MGNREGA with a new statutory framework aligned with Viksit Bharat 2047. The employment guarantee is enhanced to 125 days per rural household, strengthening income security Links wage employment with durable rural infrastructure across 4 priority areas. Strengthens decentralised planning through Viksit Gram Panchayat Plans and nationally integrated through the Viksit Bharat National Rural Infrastructure Stack. The shift to normative funding and a centrally sponsored structure improves    predictability, accountability and Centre-State partnership. Introduction Rural employment has been a cornerstone of India’s social protection framework for nearly two decades. Since its enactment in 2005 , the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA ) played a key role in providing wage employment, stabilising rural incomes and creating basic infrastructure. Over time, however, the structure and objectives of rural India have evolved significantly. Rising incomes, expanded connectivity, widespread digital penetration and diversified livelihoods have altered the nature of rural employment needs. Against this backdrop, the Government has proposed the Viksit Bharat- Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill, 2025 , also referred to as Viksit Bharat- G RAM G Bill, 2025 . The Bill represents a comprehensive statutory overhaul of MGNREGA , aligning rural employment with the long-term vision of Viksit Bharat 2047 , while strengthening accountability, infrastructure outcomes and income security. Background of Rural Employment and Development Policy in India Since Independence, rural development policies in India have focused on reducing poverty, improving agricultural productivity, and creating employment for surplus and underemployed rural labour. Wage employment programmes have gradually evolved as key instruments for supporting rural livelihoods while also strengthening basic infrastructure, with approaches adapting to changing socio-economic conditions over time. India’s wage employment initiatives progressed through multiple phases, beginning with early programmes such as the Rural Manpower Programme (1960s) and the Crash Scheme for Rural Employment (1971). These were followed by more structured efforts in the 1980s and 1990s , including the National Rural Employment Programme, Rural Landless Employment Guarantee Programme , later merged into Jawahar Rozgar Yojana (1993), which consolidated into Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana in 1999, aimed at improving coverage and coordination. Complementary schemes such as the Employment Assurance Scheme and the Food for Work Programme addressed seasonal unemployment and food security. A major shift came with the Maharashtra Employment Guarantee Act of 1977 , which introduced the concept of a statutory right to work. These experiences culminated in the enactment of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) in 2005 , providing a nationwide legal framework for rural employment generation. MGNREGA Evolution and the Limits of Incremental Reform The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) was a flagship programme aimed at enhancing livelihood security by providing at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment each year to rural households willing to undertake unskilled manual work. Over the years, a range of administrative and technological reforms strengthened its implementation, leading to notable improvements in participation, transparency, and digital governance. Women’s participation rose steadily from 48 per cent to 58.15 per cent between FY 2013-14 and FY 2025-26 , Aadhaar seeding expanded sharply, the Aadhaar-Based Payment System was widely adopted, and electronic wage payments became nearly universal. Monitoring of works also improved, with a large expansion in geo-tagged assets and a growing share of individual assets created at the household level. The experience under MGNREGA also highlighted the critical role played by field-level staff, who ensured continuity and scale of implementation despite working with limited administrative resources and staffing. However, alongside these gains, deeper structural issues persisted. Monitoring across several states revealed gaps such as work not found on the ground, expenditure not matching physical progress, use of machines in labour-intensive works, and frequent bypassing of digital attendance systems. Over time, misappropriation accumulated, and only a small proportion of households were able to complete the full one hundred days of employment in the post pandemic period. These trends indicated that while delivery systems improved, the overall architecture of MGNREGA had reached its limits. The Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission Gramin Bill responds to this experience through a comprehensive legislative reset. It strengthens the implementation framework by increasing the administrative expenditure ceiling from 6 per cent to 9 per cent , providing greater support for staffing, remuneration, training, and technical capacity. This shift reflects a practical and people-centred approach to programme management, moving towards a more professional and adequately supported system. Stronger administrative capacity is expected to improve planning and execution, enhance service delivery, and reinforce accountability, ensuring that the objectives of the new framework are achieved consistently at the village level. Rationale for a New Statutory Framework The need for reform is also rooted in broader socio-economic changes. MGNREGA was built in 2005, but rural India has transformed. Poverty levels declined from 27.1 per cent in 2011-12 to 5.3 per cent in 2022-23 , supported by rising consumption, improved financial access, and expanded welfare coverage. With rural livelihoods becoming more diversified and digitally integrated, the open-ended and demand-driven design of MGNREGA no longer aligns fully with contemporary rural realities. The Viksit Bharat- G RAM G Bill, 2025 responds to this context by modernising rural employment guarantees, strengthening accountability, and aligning employment creation with long term infrastructure and climate resilience goals. Key Features of the Viksit Bharat- G RAM G Bill, 2025 The Bill guarantees 125 days of wage employment per rural household in each financial year to such rural households whose adult members volunteer to undertake unskilled manual work, contributing to income security beyond the earlier 100-day entitlement, with an aggregated 60-day no-work period to ensure the availability of agricultural labour during peak sowing and harvesting season. Workers continue to receive 125 guaranteed days of employment within the remaining 305 days , ensuring that both farmers and labourers benefit. The disbursement of daily wages shall be made on a weekly basis or, in any case, not later than a fortnight after the date on which such work was done. Employment creation is integrated with infrastructure development through four priority verticals: Water security through water-related works Core-rural infrastructure Livelihood- related infrastructure Special works to mitigate extreme weather events All assets created are aggregated into the Viksit Bharat National Rural Infrastructure Stack, ensuring a unified, coordinated national development strategy. Planning is decentralised through Viksit Gram Panchayat Plans , which are prepared locally and spatially integrated with national systems such as PM Gati Shakti. MGNREGA vs VIKSIT BHARAT- G RAM G Bill, 2025 The new Bill represents a major upgrade over MGNREGA, fixing structural weaknesses while enhancing employment, transparency, planning, and accountability. The Financial Architecture The shift from a central sector scheme to a centrally sponsored framework reflects the inherently local nature of rural employment and asset creation . Under the new architecture, states share both cost and responsibility through a normative allocation framework , creating stronger incentives for effective implementation and preventing misuse. Planning is grounded in regional realities through Gram Panchayat Plans . At the same time, the Centre continues to set standards, while states execute with accountability, resulting in a cooperative partnership that improves efficiency and strengthens outcomes. The total estimated annual requirement of funds on wage, material, and administrative components is Rs. 1,51,282 crore , including the State share. Of this, the estimated Central share is Rs. 95,692.31 crore . This transition does not impose an undue financial burden on states . The funding structure is calibrated to state capacity, with a standard cost-sharing ratio of 60:40 between the Centre and states , enhanced support of 90:10 for North Eastern and Himalayan states, and 100 per cent central funding for Union Territories without legislatures . States were already bearing a share of material and administrative costs under the earlier framework, and the move to predictable normative allocations further supports sound budgeting. Provisions for additional assistance to states during disasters and stronger oversight mechanisms also help reduce long term losses arising from misappropriation, reinforcing fiscal sustainability alongside accountability. Benefits of the Viksit Bharat- G RAM G Bill The Bill strengthens the rural economy by linking employment generation with productive asset creation, leading to higher household incomes and improved resilience. Priority is given to water-related works, supporting agriculture and groundwater recharge. Investment in core rural infrastructure, such as roads and connectivity, improves market access, while livelihood infrastructure, including storage, markets, and production assets, enables income diversification. Climate resilience is strengthened through works focused on water harvesting, flood drainage, and soil conservation . The guarantee of 125 days of employment raises household earnings, stimulates village-level consumption, and helps reduce distress-driven migration, supported by digital attendance, wage payments, and data-driven planning. Farmers benefit from assured labour availability through state-notified pauses in public works during peak sowing and harvesting seasons, prevention of wage inflation, and improved irrigation, storage, and connectivity . Labourers gain from higher potential earnings, predictable work through Viksit Gram Panchayat Plans, secure digital wage payments, direct benefits from the assets they help create, and a mandatory unemployment allowance . Where work is not provided , a daily unemployment allowance becomes payable after 15 days , with liability resting on the States . The rates and conditions are to be prescribed through rules, ensuring flexibility while safeguarding workers’ rights and promoting the timely provision of employment. Implementing and Monitoring Authorities The Bill establishes a clear institutional framework to ensure coordinated, accountable, and transparent implementation of the Mission across national, State, district, block, and village levels. Central and State Gramin Rozgar Guarantee Councils provide policy guidance, review implementation, and strengthen accountability. National and State Steering Committees drive strategic direction, convergence, and performance review. Panchayati Raj Institutions lead planning and execution, with Gram Panchayats implementing at least half of the works in terms of cost. District Programme Coordinators and Programme Officers manage planning, compliance, payments, and social audits. Gram Sabhas play a strengthened role in conducting social audits and ensuring transparency through access to all records. Transparency, Accountability, and Social Protection The Bill equips the Central Government with clear enforcement powers to ensure compliance and protect public funds. It authorises the Centre to investigate complaints relating to implementation, suspend fund releases where serious irregularities are detected, and direct corrective or remedial measures to address deficiencies . These provisions strengthen accountability across the system, maintain financial discipline, and enable timely intervention to prevent misuse. The Bill also establishes a comprehensive transparency framework covering every stage of implementation. It enables the use of artificial intelligence and biometric authentication to identify irregularities early, supported by Central and State Steering Committees that provide continuous guidance and coordination. A focused approach through four clearly defined rural development verticals allows closer tracking of outcomes. Panchayats are assigned an enhanced role in supervision, complemented by GPS and mobile-based monitoring of works in real time. Real-time MIS dashboards and weekly public disclosures ensure public visibility, while social audits mandated at least once every six months reinforce community participation and trust. Conclusion The Viksit Bharat- Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill, 2025, represents a decisive shift in India’s rural employment policy. While MGNREGA achieved significant gains in participation, digitisation, and transparency over time, persistent structural weaknesses limited its effectiveness. The new Bill builds on past improvements while addressing their shortcomings through a modern, accountable, and infrastructure-focused framework. By expanding guaranteed employment, aligning work with national development priorities, and embedding strong digital governance, the Bill repositions rural employment as a strategic instrument for sustainable growth and resilient livelihoods, fully aligned with the vision of Viksit Bharat 2047.

MGNREGA vs VIKSIT BHARAT- G RAM G Bill, 2025 The new Bill represents a major upgrade over MGNREGA, fixing structural weaknesses while enhancing employment, transparency, planning, and accountability. The Financial Architecture The shift from a central sector scheme to a centrally sponsored framework reflects the inherently local nature of rural employment and asset creation . Under the new architecture, states share both cost and responsibility through a normative allocation framework , creating stronger incentives for effective implementation and preventing misuse. Planning is grounded in regional realities through Gram Panchayat Plans . At the same time, the Centre continues to set standards, while states execute with accountability, resulting in a cooperative partnership that improves efficiency and strengthens outcomes. The total estimated annual requirement of funds on wage, material, and administrative components is Rs. 1,51,282 crore , including the State share. Of this, the estimated Central share is Rs. 95,692.31 crore . This transition does not impose an undue financial burden on states . The funding structure is calibrated to state capacity, with a standard cost-sharing ratio of 60:40 between the Centre and states , enhanced support of 90:10 for North Eastern and Himalayan states, and 100 per cent central funding for Union Territories without legislatures . States were already bearing a share of material and administrative costs under the earlier framework, and the move to predictable normative allocations further supports sound budgeting. Provisions for additional assistance to states during disasters and stronger oversight mechanisms also help reduce long term losses arising from misappropriation, reinforcing fiscal sustainability alongside accountability. Benefits of the Viksit Bharat- G RAM G Bill The Bill strengthens the rural economy by linking employment generation with productive asset creation, leading to higher household incomes and improved resilience. Priority is given to water-related works, supporting agriculture and groundwater recharge. Investment in core rural infrastructure, such as roads and connectivity, improves market access, while livelihood infrastructure, including storage, markets, and production assets, enables income diversification. Climate resilience is strengthened through works focused on water harvesting, flood drainage, and soil conservation . The guarantee of 125 days of employment raises household earnings, stimulates village-level consumption, and helps reduce distress-driven migration, supported by digital attendance, wage payments, and data-driven planning. Farmers benefit from assured labour availability through state-notified pauses in public works during peak sowing and harvesting seasons, prevention of wage inflation, and improved irrigation, storage, and connectivity . Labourers gain from higher potential earnings, predictable work through Viksit Gram Panchayat Plans, secure digital wage payments, direct benefits from the assets they help create, and a mandatory unemployment allowance . Where work is not provided , a daily unemployment allowance becomes payable after 15 days , with liability resting on the States . The rates and conditions are to be prescribed through rules, ensuring flexibility while safeguarding workers’ rights and promoting the timely provision of employment. Implementing and Monitoring Authorities The Bill establishes a clear institutional framework to ensure coordinated, accountable, and transparent implementation of the Mission across national, State, district, block, and village levels. Central and State Gramin Rozgar Guarantee Councils provide policy guidance, review implementation, and strengthen accountability. National and State Steering Committees drive strategic direction, convergence, and performance review. Panchayati Raj Institutions lead planning and execution, with Gram Panchayats implementing at least half of the works in terms of cost. District Programme Coordinators and Programme Officers manage planning, compliance, payments, and social audits. Gram Sabhas play a strengthened role in conducting social audits and ensuring transparency through access to all records. Transparency, Accountability, and Social Protection The Bill equips the Central Government with clear enforcement powers to ensure compliance and protect public funds. It authorises the Centre to investigate complaints relating to implementation, suspend fund releases where serious irregularities are detected, and direct corrective or remedial measures to address deficiencies . These provisions strengthen accountability across the system, maintain financial discipline, and enable timely intervention to prevent misuse. The Bill also establishes a comprehensive transparency framework covering every stage of implementation. It enables the use of artificial intelligence and biometric authentication to identify irregularities early, supported by Central and State Steering Committees that provide continuous guidance and coordination. A focused approach through four clearly defined rural development verticals allows closer tracking of outcomes. Panchayats are assigned an enhanced role in supervision, complemented by GPS and mobile-based monitoring of works in real time. Real-time MIS dashboards and weekly public disclosures ensure public visibility, while social audits mandated at least once every six months reinforce community participation and trust. Conclusion The Viksit Bharat- Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill, 2025, represents a decisive shift in India’s rural employment policy. While MGNREGA achieved significant gains in participation, digitisation, and transparency over time, persistent structural weaknesses limited its effectiveness. The new Bill builds on past improvements while addressing their shortcomings through a modern, accountable, and infrastructure-focused framework. By expanding guaranteed employment, aligning work with national development priorities, and embedding strong digital governance, the Bill repositions rural employment as a strategic instrument for sustainable growth and resilient livelihoods, fully aligned with the vision of Viksit Bharat 2047.

He noted that the message of love, harmony and moral courage taught by Lord Jesus Christ has timeless relevance and resonates deeply with India’s own spiritual traditions that emphasise coexistence, compassion and respect for human dignity. Recalling the long presence of Christianity in India, the Vice-President highlighted the quiet yet significant contribution of the Christian community to India’s social, cultural and developmental journey. He lauded the community’s sustained work in education, healthcare, social reform and human development, which has reached even the remotest parts of the country, and described it as an integral part of nation-building.

                18 DEC 2025 4:08PM by PIB Delhi Your Excellency क़ैस अल यूसुफ़, Minister of Commerce, Industry and Investment Promotion, दोनों देशों के delegates, बिजनेस वर्ल्ड के लीडर्स, देवियों और सज्जनों ! नमस्कार। मुझे सात वर्ष बाद ओमान आने का सौभाग्य मिला है। और आज आप सभी के साथ बातचीत करने का अवसर मिल रहा है। इस Business Summit के लिए आपकी गर्मजोशी मेरा भी उत्साह बढ़ा रही है। आज की यह Summit, भारत–ओमान partnership को नई दिशा देगी, नई गति देगी, और नई बुलंदियों तक पहुंचाने में मदद करेगी। और इसमें आप सभी का बहुत बड़ा रोल है। Friends, आप भारत और ओमान के बिजनेस, हमारे ट्रेड को रिप्रेज़ेंट करते हैं। आप उस विरासत के वारिस हैं जिसका सदियों का एक समृद्ध इतिहास रहा है। सभ्यता के आरंभ से ही, हमारे पूर्वज एक दूसरे के साथ maritime trade कर रहे थे। अक्सर कहा जाता है कि समंदर के दो किनारे बहुत दूर होते हैं, लेकिन मांडवी और मस्कट के बीच, अरब सागर एक मजबूत ब्रिज बना है। एक ऐसा ब्रिज, जिसने हमारे रिश्तों को मजबूत किया, कल्चर और इकॉनॉमी को ताकत दी। आज हम विश्वास के साथ कह सकते हैं कि समंदर की लहरें बदलती हैं, मौसम बदलते हैं, लेकिन भारत–ओमान की दोस्ती हर मौसम में और मज़बूत होती है, और हर लहर के साथ नई ऊंचाई को छूती है। Friends, हमारा रिश्ता trust की नींव पर बना, friendship की ताक़त से आगे बढ़ा, और समय के साथ और गहराता चला गया। आज हमारे डिप्लोमेटिक रिश्ते भी seventy years के हो गए हैं। ये सिर्फ सत्तर वर्ष का उत्सव नहीं है, ये वो पड़ाव है जहां से हमें अपनी सदियों की विरासत को एक समृद्ध भविष्य की तरफ ले जाना है। Friends, आज हम एक ऐसा ऐतिहासिक निर्णय ले रहे हैं, जिसकी गूँज आने वाले कई दशकों तक सुनाई देगी। Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, यानि सीपा, हमारी पार्टनरशिप को, ट्वेंटी फर्स्ट सेंचुरी में नया विश्वास, नई ऊर्जा से भर देगा। यह हमारे साझा भविष्य का ब्लूप्रिंट है। यह हमारे ट्रेड को नई गति देगा, investment को नया भरोसा देगा, और हर सेक्टर में अवसरों के नए द्वार खोलेगा। सीपा, हमारे नौजवानों के लिए growth, innovation, और employment के अनेक नए अवसर बनाएगा। ये एग्रीमेंट पेपर से निकलकर, परफॉर्मेंस में बदले, इसमें आप सभी की भूमिका बहुत बड़ी है। क्योंकि जब policy और enterprise एक साथ चलते हैं, तभी partnership नया इतिहास बनाती है। Friends, भारत की प्रगति हमेशा shared progress की कहानी रही है। भारत जब ग्रो करता है, तो अपने दोस्तों को अपनी ग्रोथ का साझेदार बनाता है। आज भी हम यही कर रहे हैं। आज भारत, third largest economy बनने की तरफ तेज़ी से बढ़ रहा है। इसमें पूरी दुनिया के लिए अवसर हैं, लेकिन ओमान के लिए तो advantage और भी बड़ा है। क्योंकि हम पक्के दोस्त तो हैं ही, मैरिटाइम नेबर भी हैं। हमारे लोग एक-दूसरे को जानते हैं, हमारे बिजनेस जगत में पीढ़ियों का भरोसा है, और हम एक-दूसरे के मार्केट को बहुत ही अच्छे से समझते भी हैं। ऐसे में भारत की ग्रोथ जर्नी में, ओमान के लिए अवसर ही अवसर हैं। Friends, आज बिजनेस वर्ल्ड में भारत की इकॉनॉमी की रज़ीलियन्स की चर्चा होती है। लोग अक्सर पूछते हैं कि दुनिया में इतनी अनिश्चितता है ग्लोबल इकॉनॉमी भी मुश्किलों में है, तो ऐसे में, भारत eight percent से अधिक की ग्रोथ कैसे अचीव कर रहा है? मैं आपको इसका बड़ा reason बताता हूं। असल में बीते 11 वर्षों के दौरान भारत ने सिर्फ़ policies नहीं बदली हैं, भारत ने अपना economic DNA बदला है। मैं आपको कुछ उदाहरण देता हूं, जैसे गुड्स एंड सर्विसेज़ टैक्स यानि GST, इसने पूरे भारत को एक integrated, unified market में बदला है। इन्सॉलवेंसी एंड बैंकरप्सी कोड से financial discipline आया, transparency को बढ़ावा मिला, और इससे investor confidence मज़बूत हुआ। ऐसे ही हमने corporate tax reforms किए। इससे भारत, दुनिया के most competitive investment destinations में से एक बन गया है। साथियों, अभी आपने लेबर रिफॉर्म्स की भी चर्चा सुनी होगी। हमने दर्जनों लेबर कोड्स को सिर्फ चार कोड्स में समेट दिया है। ये भारत के इतिहास के सबसे बड़े लेबर रिफॉर्म्स में से एक हैं। Friends, जब policy clarity आती है, तो manufacturing को भी नया विश्वास मिलता है। एक तरफ हम पॉलिसी और प्रोसेस रिफॉर्म कर रहे हैं, वहीं दूसरी तरफ, भारत में मैन्युफेक्चरिंग को बढ़ावा देने के लिए प्रोडक्शन लिंक्ड इन्सेंटिव भी दे रहे हैं। ऐसे प्रयासों से ही आज मेक इन इंडिया अभियान को लेकर दुनिया में बहुत उत्साह है। Friends, Reforms को भारत के Digital Public Infrastructure ने और ताकत दी है। Governance paperless हुई है, economy cash-less हुई है, और system कहीं ज़्यादा efficient, transparent और predictable हुआ है। डिजिटल इंडिया सिर्फ एक प्रोजेक्ट नहीं है ये दुनिया की सबसे बड़ी ‘इंक्लूजन रेवोल्यूशन’ भी है। इससे ease of living बढ़ी है, और ease of doing नए लेवल पर पहुंच चुकी है। और भारत में बन रहा आधुनिक फिज़िकल इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर, इसको और बेहतर कर रहा है। सुधरती हुई कनेक्टिविटी के कारण, भारत में logistics की cost लगातार कम होती जा रही है। Friends, भारत निवेश के लिए एक आकर्षक destination है, ये तो दुनिया मानती है। साथ ही, भारत एक भरोसेमंद, future-ready partner है। और ओमान इसको बहुत अच्छे से समझता भी है, और सराहता भी है। हमारा Joint Investment Fund, अनेक वर्षों से, दोनों देशों में निवेश को बढ़ावा दे रहा है। एनर्जी हो, oil and gas हो, फर्टिलाइजर्स, हेल्थ, पेट्रोकेमिकल्स और ग्रीन एनर्जी हो, ऐसे हर सेक्टर में नई संभावनाएं बन रही हैं। लेकिन साथियों, भारत और ओमान सिर्फ इतने से संतुष्ट नहीं हैं। हम comfort zone में नहीं रहते। हमें भारत–ओमान partnership को next level पर ले जाना है। इसके लिए, दोनों देशों के बिजनेस वर्ल्ड को अपने लिए कुछ बड़े लक्ष्य तय करने ही होंगे। आपका ये काम मैं कुछ हल्का कर देता हूं। मै आपको कुछ challenges देता हूँ। हम Green Energy में मिलकर कुछ बड़ा कर सकते हैं क्या? क्या हम अगले पांच वर्षों में पांच बड़े ग्रीन प्रोजेक्ट्स शुरू कर सकते हैं? हमें ग्रीन हाइड्रोजन, ग्रीन अमोनिया, सोलर पार्क्स, energy storage, और smart grid के क्षेत्र में नए बेंचमार्क्स बनाने हैं। Friends, एनर्जी सिक्योरिटी जितनी ज़रूरी है, उतनी ही आवश्यक Food Security भी है। आने वाले समय में ये एक बड़ा ग्लोबल चैलेंज बनने जा रहा है। क्या हम मिलकर, India - Oman Agri Innovation Hub बना सकते हैं? इससे ओमान की food security को मजबूती मिलेगी, और भारत के agri-tech को ग्लोबल मार्केट तक पहुंचाने में मदद मिलेगी। Friends, एग्रीकल्चर तो एक सेक्टर है। ऐसे ही, हर सेक्टर में Innovation को बढ़ावा देना ज़रुरी है। ऐसे में क्या हम ""Oman–India Innovation Bridge” की स्थापना कर सकते हैं? हमें ये तय करके चलना होगा कि आने वाले दो वर्षों में, 200 भारतीय और ओमानी स्टार्टअप्स को हम जोड़ें। हमें joint incubators बनाने होंगे, fintech sandboxes, AI & cybersecurity labs का निर्माण करना होगा, और cross-border venture funding को बढ़ावा देना होगा। Friends, ये सिर्फ़ ideas नहीं हैं, ये invitation हैं। Invitation—to invest.

                        18 DEC 2025 4:08PM by PIB Delhi Your Excellency क़ैस अल यूसुफ़, Minister of Commerce, Industry and Investment Promotion, दोनों देशों के delegates, बिजनेस वर्ल्ड के लीडर्स, देवियों और सज्जनों ! नमस्कार। मुझे सात वर्ष बाद ओमान आने का सौभाग्य मिला है। और आज आप सभी के साथ बातचीत करने का अवसर मिल रहा है। इस Business Summit के लिए आपकी गर्मजोशी मेरा भी उत्साह बढ़ा रही है। आज की यह Summit, भारत–ओमान partnership को नई दिशा देगी, नई गति देगी, और नई बुलंदियों तक पहुंचाने में मदद करेगी। और इसमें आप सभी का बहुत बड़ा रोल है। Friends, आप भारत और ओमान के बिजनेस, हमारे ट्रेड को रिप्रेज़ेंट करते हैं। आप उस विरासत के वारिस हैं जिसका सदियों का एक समृद्ध इतिहास रहा है। सभ्यता के आरंभ से ही, हमारे पूर्वज एक दूसरे के साथ maritime trade कर रहे थे। अक्सर कहा जाता है कि समंदर के दो किनारे बहुत दूर होते हैं, लेकिन मांडवी और मस्कट के बीच, अरब सागर एक मजबूत ब्रिज बना है। एक ऐसा ब्रिज, जिसने हमारे रिश्तों को मजबूत किया, कल्चर और इकॉनॉमी को ताकत दी। आज हम विश्वास के साथ कह सकते हैं कि समंदर की लहरें बदलती हैं, मौसम बदलते हैं, लेकिन भारत–ओमान की दोस्ती हर मौसम में और मज़बूत होती है, और हर लहर के साथ नई ऊंचाई को छूती है। Friends, हमारा रिश्ता trust की नींव पर बना, friendship की ताक़त से आगे बढ़ा, और समय के साथ और गहराता चला गया। आज हमारे डिप्लोमेटिक रिश्ते भी seventy years के हो गए हैं। ये सिर्फ सत्तर वर्ष का उत्सव नहीं है, ये वो पड़ाव है जहां से हमें अपनी सदियों की विरासत को एक समृद्ध भविष्य की तरफ ले जाना है। Friends, आज हम एक ऐसा ऐतिहासिक निर्णय ले रहे हैं, जिसकी गूँज आने वाले कई दशकों तक सुनाई देगी। Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, यानि सीपा, हमारी पार्टनरशिप को, ट्वेंटी फर्स्ट सेंचुरी में नया विश्वास, नई ऊर्जा से भर देगा। यह हमारे साझा भविष्य का ब्लूप्रिंट है। यह हमारे ट्रेड को नई गति देगा, investment को नया भरोसा देगा, और हर सेक्टर में अवसरों के नए द्वार खोलेगा। सीपा, हमारे नौजवानों के लिए growth, innovation, और employment के अनेक नए अवसर बनाएगा। ये एग्रीमेंट पेपर से निकलकर, परफॉर्मेंस में बदले, इसमें आप सभी की भूमिका बहुत बड़ी है। क्योंकि जब policy और enterprise एक साथ चलते हैं, तभी partnership नया इतिहास बनाती है। Friends, भारत की प्रगति हमेशा shared progress की कहानी रही है। भारत जब ग्रो करता है, तो अपने दोस्तों को अपनी ग्रोथ का साझेदार बनाता है। आज भी हम यही कर रहे हैं। आज भारत, third largest economy बनने की तरफ तेज़ी से बढ़ रहा है। इसमें पूरी दुनिया के लिए अवसर हैं, लेकिन ओमान के लिए तो advantage और भी बड़ा है। क्योंकि हम पक्के दोस्त तो हैं ही, मैरिटाइम नेबर भी हैं। हमारे लोग एक-दूसरे को जानते हैं, हमारे बिजनेस जगत में पीढ़ियों का भरोसा है, और हम एक-दूसरे के मार्केट को बहुत ही अच्छे से समझते भी हैं। ऐसे में भारत की ग्रोथ जर्नी में, ओमान के लिए अवसर ही अवसर हैं। Friends, आज बिजनेस वर्ल्ड में भारत की इकॉनॉमी की रज़ीलियन्स की चर्चा होती है। लोग अक्सर पूछते हैं कि दुनिया में इतनी अनिश्चितता है ग्लोबल इकॉनॉमी भी मुश्किलों में है, तो ऐसे में, भारत eight percent से अधिक की ग्रोथ कैसे अचीव कर रहा है? मैं आपको इसका बड़ा reason बताता हूं। असल में बीते 11 वर्षों के दौरान भारत ने सिर्फ़ policies नहीं बदली हैं, भारत ने अपना economic DNA बदला है। मैं आपको कुछ उदाहरण देता हूं, जैसे गुड्स एंड सर्विसेज़ टैक्स यानि GST, इसने पूरे भारत को एक integrated, unified market में बदला है। इन्सॉलवेंसी एंड बैंकरप्सी कोड से financial discipline आया, transparency को बढ़ावा मिला, और इससे investor confidence मज़बूत हुआ। ऐसे ही हमने corporate tax reforms किए। इससे भारत, दुनिया के most competitive investment destinations में से एक बन गया है। साथियों, अभी आपने लेबर रिफॉर्म्स की भी चर्चा सुनी होगी। हमने दर्जनों लेबर कोड्स को सिर्फ चार कोड्स में समेट दिया है। ये भारत के इतिहास के सबसे बड़े लेबर रिफॉर्म्स में से एक हैं। Friends, जब policy clarity आती है, तो manufacturing को भी नया विश्वास मिलता है। एक तरफ हम पॉलिसी और प्रोसेस रिफॉर्म कर रहे हैं, वहीं दूसरी तरफ, भारत में मैन्युफेक्चरिंग को बढ़ावा देने के लिए प्रोडक्शन लिंक्ड इन्सेंटिव भी दे रहे हैं। ऐसे प्रयासों से ही आज मेक इन इंडिया अभियान को लेकर दुनिया में बहुत उत्साह है। Friends, Reforms को भारत के Digital Public Infrastructure ने और ताकत दी है। Governance paperless हुई है, economy cash-less हुई है, और system कहीं ज़्यादा efficient, transparent और predictable हुआ है। डिजिटल इंडिया सिर्फ एक प्रोजेक्ट नहीं है ये दुनिया की सबसे बड़ी ‘इंक्लूजन रेवोल्यूशन’ भी है। इससे ease of living बढ़ी है, और ease of doing नए लेवल पर पहुंच चुकी है। और भारत में बन रहा आधुनिक फिज़िकल इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर, इसको और बेहतर कर रहा है। सुधरती हुई कनेक्टिविटी के कारण, भारत में logistics की cost लगातार कम होती जा रही है। Friends, भारत निवेश के लिए एक आकर्षक destination है, ये तो दुनिया मानती है। साथ ही, भारत एक भरोसेमंद, future-ready partner है। और ओमान इसको बहुत अच्छे से समझता भी है, और सराहता भी है। हमारा Joint Investment Fund, अनेक वर्षों से, दोनों देशों में निवेश को बढ़ावा दे रहा है। एनर्जी हो, oil and gas हो, फर्टिलाइजर्स, हेल्थ, पेट्रोकेमिकल्स और ग्रीन एनर्जी हो, ऐसे हर सेक्टर में नई संभावनाएं बन रही हैं। लेकिन साथियों, भारत और ओमान सिर्फ इतने से संतुष्ट नहीं हैं। हम comfort zone में नहीं रहते। हमें भारत–ओमान partnership को next level पर ले जाना है। इसके लिए, दोनों देशों के बिजनेस वर्ल्ड को अपने लिए कुछ बड़े लक्ष्य तय करने ही होंगे। आपका ये काम मैं कुछ हल्का कर देता हूं। मै आपको कुछ challenges देता हूँ। हम Green Energy में मिलकर कुछ बड़ा कर सकते हैं क्या? क्या हम अगले पांच वर्षों में पांच बड़े ग्रीन प्रोजेक्ट्स शुरू कर सकते हैं? हमें ग्रीन हाइड्रोजन, ग्रीन अमोनिया, सोलर पार्क्स, energy storage, और smart grid के क्षेत्र में नए बेंचमार्क्स बनाने हैं। Friends, एनर्जी सिक्योरिटी जितनी ज़रूरी है, उतनी ही आवश्यक Food Security भी है। आने वाले समय में ये एक बड़ा ग्लोबल चैलेंज बनने जा रहा है। क्या हम मिलकर, India - Oman Agri Innovation Hub बना सकते हैं? इससे ओमान की food security को मजबूती मिलेगी, और भारत के agri-tech को ग्लोबल मार्केट तक पहुंचाने में मदद मिलेगी। Friends, एग्रीकल्चर तो एक सेक्टर है। ऐसे ही, हर सेक्टर में Innovation को बढ़ावा देना ज़रुरी है। ऐसे में क्या हम ""Oman–India Innovation Bridge” की स्थापना कर सकते हैं? हमें ये तय करके चलना होगा कि आने वाले दो वर्षों में, 200 भारतीय और ओमानी स्टार्टअप्स को हम जोड़ें। हमें joint incubators बनाने होंगे, fintech sandboxes, AI & cybersecurity labs का निर्माण करना होगा, और cross-border venture funding को बढ़ावा देना होगा। Friends, ये सिर्फ़ ideas नहीं हैं, ये invitation हैं। Invitation—to invest. Invitation—to innovate. Invitation—to build the future, together. आइए, हम इस पुरानी मित्रता को नई technology, नई एनर्जी और नए सपनों की शक्ति से आगे बढ़ाएं। ""शुक्रन जज़ी--लन!” Thank you! *** MJPS/ST (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205919)","2025-12-18T17:48:38.741459"

                18 DEC 2025 7:48PM by PIB Delhi Responding to a series of questions in Parliament on the rising burden of cancer in the country, Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Science & Technology, Earth Sciences, and MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh today highlighted the Government’s multi-pronged, future-ready strategy to strengthen cancer prevention, diagnosis, treatment, research, and affordability, particularly for economically weaker sections. Addressing concerns related to hospital admissions, rising cancer incidence, affordability of medicines, vaccines, global collaborations, and access to advanced nuclear therapies, the Minister said the Government is transforming cancer care from selective excellence to universal accessibility, driven by research, technology, and public health integration. Dr. Jitendra Singh acknowledged that cancer patients and their families often face emotional and logistical stress during hospital admissions. He said the Government is working towards streamlining admission procedures, while simultaneously expanding oncology facilities at the district level to reduce referral pressure on tertiary hospitals. The minister highlighted that since 2014, 11 Tata Memorial Centre hospitals have been established across the country, along with a national cancer care grid covering over 300 hospitals, ensuring standardized and accessible cancer services closer to patients’ homes. Major expansions, including a Platinum Block at Navi Mumbai, are also underway. Addressing concerns over the growing prevalence of cancer, Dr. Singh said the rise is a global phenomenon, driven by longer life expectancy, environmental factors, lifestyle changes, and early onset of non-communicable diseases.“Cancer today is no longer a disease of old age alone. Early diagnosis has transformed many cancers from fatal to curable,” the Minister said. Dr. Jitendra Singh informed the House that extensive research is underway through institutions such as the Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology (BRIT), Tata Memorial Centre, and teaching hospitals, focusing not only on cancer itself but also on reducing side effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy through radioprotective agents and precision-targeted technologies. Dr. Jitendra Singh said that affordability remains central to the Government’s cancer care policy. At Tata Memorial Centre, nearly 60% of patients receive treatment free or at nominal cost, supported by schemes such as Ayushman Bharat, while even paid services are significantly cheaper than corporate hospitals. The Minister said the Government is ensuring timely availability of essential cancer medicines through public hospitals and indigenous production, reducing dependence on expensive imports. Dr. Jitendra Singh also highlighted that India has developed its first indigenous HPV vaccine, a landmark achievement led by the Department of Biotechnology. The vaccine has a preventive role against cervical cancer, which remains one of the most common cancers among young Indian women. On international collaboration, Dr. Jitendra Singh highlighted Tata Memorial Centre’s partnership with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) under the “Rays of Hope” initiative, which is training healthcare professionals from low- and middle-income countries.He said Tata Memorial uniquely combines patient care, teaching, and cutting-edge research, operating as a deemed university and offering super-specialty training in oncology, paediatric oncology, and nuclear medicine across multiple states, including Assam. Responding to questions on advanced theranostics such as Lutetium-177 PSMA-617 for prostate cancer, Dr. Jitendra Singh said India has developed 24 indigenous radioisotopes over the past decade for diagnostic and therapeutic use.These include world-class innovations for prostate cancer and childhood blood cancers, ensuring that cutting-edge nuclear medicine is affordable and scalable, even in logistically challenging rural areas. ***** NKR/AK (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2206213) आगंतुक पटल  : 124 इस विज्ञप्ति को इन भाषाओं में पढ़ें: Urdu , हिन्दी Department of Atomic Energy Government Scaling Up Cancer Care, Research, and Affordable Advanced Therapies Across India: Dr. Jitendra Singh Cancer Care Being Transformed from Selective Excellence to Universal Accessibility, Says Dr Jitendra Singh in Parliament Nearly 60% Cancer Patients Treated Free or at Nominal Cost at Tata Memorial Centre: Dr Jitendra Singh Rising Cancer Incidence a Global Trend; Early Detection Making Many Cancers Curable: Dr Jitendra Singh प्रविष्टि तिथि:
                        18 DEC 2025 7:48PM by PIB Delhi Responding to a series of questions in Parliament on the rising burden of cancer in the country, Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Science & Technology, Earth Sciences, and MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh today highlighted the Government’s multi-pronged, future-ready strategy to strengthen cancer prevention, diagnosis, treatment, research, and affordability, particularly for economically weaker sections. Addressing concerns related to hospital admissions, rising cancer incidence, affordability of medicines, vaccines, global collaborations, and access to advanced nuclear therapies, the Minister said the Government is transforming cancer care from selective excellence to universal accessibility, driven by research, technology, and public health integration. Dr. Jitendra Singh acknowledged that cancer patients and their families often face emotional and logistical stress during hospital admissions. He said the Government is working towards streamlining admission procedures, while simultaneously expanding oncology facilities at the district level to reduce referral pressure on tertiary hospitals. The minister highlighted that since 2014, 11 Tata Memorial Centre hospitals have been established across the country, along with a national cancer care grid covering over 300 hospitals, ensuring standardized and accessible cancer services closer to patients’ homes. Major expansions, including a Platinum Block at Navi Mumbai, are also underway. Addressing concerns over the growing prevalence of cancer, Dr. Singh said the rise is a global phenomenon, driven by longer life expectancy, environmental factors, lifestyle changes, and early onset of non-communicable diseases.“Cancer today is no longer a disease of old age alone. Early diagnosis has transformed many cancers from fatal to curable,” the Minister said. Dr. Jitendra Singh informed the House that extensive research is underway through institutions such as the Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology (BRIT), Tata Memorial Centre, and teaching hospitals, focusing not only on cancer itself but also on reducing side effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy through radioprotective agents and precision-targeted technologies. Dr. Jitendra Singh said that affordability remains central to the Government’s cancer care policy. At Tata Memorial Centre, nearly 60% of patients receive treatment free or at nominal cost, supported by schemes such as Ayushman Bharat, while even paid services are significantly cheaper than corporate hospitals.

                18 DEC 2025 7:45PM by PIB Delhi Following the passage of The Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill, 2025 by the Lok Sabha, Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Science & Technology, Earth Sciences, and Minister of State in the PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh today participated in an extensive discussion on the Bill in the Rajya Sabha, clarifying key provisions, addressing concerns raised by Members, and firmly underlining that nuclear safety, national sovereignty and public accountability remain non-negotiable. Dr Jitendra Singh explained that the Bill consolidates and rationalises provisions from the Atomic Energy Act, 1962, the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act, and now accords statutory status to the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, making it part of the parent legislation. This, he said, strengthens regulatory oversight rather than diluting it, and reflects India’s commitment to global best practices in nuclear governance. Highlighting the changing global and technological context, Dr Jitendra Singh said that objections raised to nuclear reforms in 2010 must be viewed in the light of today’s realities, where technology, safety systems and global energy demands have transformed dramatically. Concepts such as Small Modular Reactors and Bharat Small Reactors, he noted, were unimaginable fifteen years ago, but are now emerging as safe, efficient, and flexible solutions for clean, 24×7 power generation. Addressing safety concerns, the Minister categorically stated that nuclear safety standards remain unchanged and uncompromised, governed by the same stringent principles enshrined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1962- “safety first, production next.” He detailed the rigorous inspection regime, including quarterly inspections during construction, biannual inspections during operation, five-yearly licence renewals, enhanced powers to the now-statutory Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, and oversight aligned with International Atomic Energy Agency parameters. He further reassured the House that India’s nuclear plants are geographically located far from seismic fault zones and that radiation levels at Indian reactors are many times below prescribed global safety limits. Dr Jitendra Singh also addressed public health apprehensions, stating that there is no scientific evidence of carcinogenic impact from Indian nuclear reactors. He cited radiation emission data in micro-sieverts, demonstrating that levels at facilities such as Kudankulam, Kalpakkam, Rawatbhata and Tarapur are far below permissible limits. He added that India has significantly upgraded cyber security safeguards in the nuclear sector, including encryption, secure coding, regular audits, malware filtering, and multi-layered digital protection, reflecting new-age threat preparedness. Clarifying misconceptions about privatisation, the Minister stated that while exploration activities may involve private partners under defined conditions, uranium mining beyond specified thresholds will remain exclusively with the government. Similarly, spent fuel management will always remain under government custody, following a clearly defined, long-term storage and handling protocol. Strategic materials such as source material, fissile material and heavy water will continue to be under strict government control. On liability and compensation, Dr Jitendra Singh explained that the Bill introduces graded liability caps to encourage participation by smaller investors without diluting victim compensation. He assured that in the event of damage exceeding operator liability limits, full compensation mechanisms are provided through government-backed funds and international conventions, ensuring that affected parties are not left unprotected. The definition of “nuclear damage” has also been expanded to explicitly include environmental damage. The Minister highlighted the introduction of the Atomic Energy Redressal Commission, stating that it is meant to provide an additional, faster dispute-resolution mechanism for citizens, without restricting access to civil courts or higher judiciary. He rejected claims that the Bill places nuclear matters outside judicial scrutiny. Responding to concerns on sovereignty and foreign influence, Dr Jitendra Singh asserted that India will adopt only those international best practices that suit Indian conditions, without compromising strategic autonomy or traditional strengths. He reiterated that the SHANTI Bill pertains strictly to civilian nuclear energy, with uranium enrichment levels limited to reactor requirements and completely unrelated to weapons-grade activities. Dr Jitendra Singh also drew attention to the expanding role of nuclear science in healthcare, agriculture, food preservation, and cancer treatment, citing advances in nuclear medicine for childhood leukaemia and prostate cancer through institutions such as Tata Memorial Centre. He said liberalising research participation would accelerate innovation across these sectors. Outlining India’s long-term nuclear energy roadmap, the Minister stated that the country has already achieved nearly 9 GW of nuclear capacity, with targets of 22 GW by 2032, 47 GW by 2037, 67 GW by 2042 and 100 GW by 2047, contributing nearly 10% of India’s total energy needs. He emphasised that nuclear power will be indispensable in meeting future energy demands driven by artificial intelligence and digital infrastructure, as it provides reliable, round-the-clock clean energy unlike intermittent sources. Concluding his address, Dr Jitendra Singh said the SHANTI Bill reflects India’s confidence, scientific maturity, and readiness to lead responsibly in the global clean energy transition. He assured Members that the Government remains open to constructive inputs and will continue engaging stakeholders during rule-making, reaffirming that India’s nuclear journey will be guided by safety, transparency, and national interest. ***** NKR/AK (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2206211) आगंतुक पटल  : 274 इस विज्ञप्ति को इन भाषाओं में पढ़ें: Urdu Department of Atomic Energy Rajya Sabha passes SHANTI Bill 2025, after it was passed by Lok Sabha Government Retains Full Control Over Strategic Materials, Spent Fuel, and Nuclear Safety Remains Non-Negotiable Under SHANTI Bill: Dr Jitendra Singh From Hospitals to Farms to Cancer Care: Nuclear Science Driving India’s Everyday Life, Says Dr Jitendra Singh PM Modi’s Vision Unlocks Nuclear Energy Reforms While Safeguarding Safety, Sovereignty and Public Interest: Dr Jitendra Singh Radiation at Indian Nuclear Plants Well Below Global Limits; No Cancer Risk, Dr. Jitendra Singh at Rajya Sabha प्रविष्टि तिथि:

                18 DEC 2025 6:13PM by PIB Delhi In furtherance of reforms and aligned with the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat, the Ministry of Coal has undertaken measures to simplify the process for disposal of coal washery rejects. These measures are aimed at reducing procedural requirements, enhancing ease of doing business, and facilitating timely and efficient utilisation of washery rejects while ensuring environmental responsibility. At present, the coal washery rejects from the coal washeries are disposed as per the policy dated 27.05.2021 issued by Ministry of Coal for handling & disposal of washery rejects.  These rejects are disposed in order of priority, with 1 st priority given for use of washery rejects for extraction of energy. This is in line with Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, which requires extraction of energy from solid wastes of high calorific value of 1500 kcal/kg or more. The 2 nd priority is for replacement of construction material, reclamation of land, brick making or any other alternative gainful use. If both the above options do not fructify, the last option is to dump the washery rejects in mine voids or low- lying areas in an environment friendly manner. The disposal of washery rejects in all the above three options required prior permission of the Coal Controller Organisation (CCO) and that required some processing time at CCO. In the spirit of ease of doing business, Government has now dispensed with the requirement of prior permission of CCO for the disposal of washery rejects under the first two options i.e. extraction of energy and replacement of construction material, reclamation of land, brick making or any other alternative gainful use. Prior permission of CCO for the last option continues considering the close involvement of CCO in the disposal of washery rejects under the last option. CCO continues to have the power to inspect concerned washery, check the records and draw the samples from the reject stock / reject in transit for verifying the GCV.  The amendment in the Policy may be seen at the weblink https://coal.gov.in/sites/default/files/2025-12/18-12-2025crp.pdf Dispensation with the requirement of prior permission of CCO for the disposal of washery rejects has simplified the entire process and would expedite the disposal of washery rejects. Washery rejects can now be disposed at a faster, simpler and efficient manner. The simplified framework is expected to facilitate faster, simpler, and more efficient disposal of coal washery rejects, encouraging their productive utilisation and reducing operational delays. By promoting optimal use of domestic coal resources and ensuring necessary regulatory oversight, the reform contributes to strengthening energy security and supports the journey towards a Viksit Bharat through a resilient and sustainable energy ecosystem. **** Shuhaib T (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2206130) आगंतुक पटल  : 171 इस विज्ञप्ति को इन भाषाओं में पढ़ें: हिन्दी Ministry of Coal Simplification in the Process of the Disposal of Washery Rejects प्रविष्टि तिथि:

                18 DEC 2025 3:53PM by PIB Delhi India and Oman have taken a significant step in building a stronger economic partnership with the signing of Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement today under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. Commerce and Industry Minister Shri Piyush Goyal and Oman’s Minister of Commerce, Industry & Investment Promotion H.E. Qais bin Mohammed Al Yousef signed the agreement. This Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) marks an important milestone in India’s engagement with the Gulf region and reflects the shared commitment to deepen bilateral economic integration. Oman is an important strategic partner in the region and is a key gateway for Indian goods and services to the wider Middle East and Africa. Nearly 7 lakh Indian nationals reside in Oman, including Indian merchant families with a presence of over 200–300 years, contributing significantly to Oman’s economy and society. Indian enterprises have built a strong presence in Oman, with over 6,000 Indian establishments operating across sectors. Annual remittances of around USD 2 billion further reflect the depth of economic engagement. Bilateral trade between India and Oman stands at over USD 10 billion, with strong potential for expansion under the CEPA framework. This is the 2nd Free Trade Agreement signed in the last 6 months after United Kingdom and is a part of strategy to sign trade agreements with developed economies that are not competing with our labour-intensive interests and provide opportunities for Indian businesses. The CEPA secures unprecedented tariff concessions for India from Oman. Oman has offered zero-duty access on 98.08% of its tariff lines, covering 99.38% of India’s exports to Oman. All major labour-intensive sectors including Gems & Jewellery, Textiles, leather, footwear, sports goods, plastics, furniture, agricultural products, engineering products, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and Automobiles receive full tariff elimination.  Out of the above, immediate tariff elimination is being offered on 97.96% Tariff Lines. India is offering tariff liberalization on 77.79% of its total tariff lines (12556) which covers 94.81% of India’s imports from Oman by value. For the products of export interest to Oman and which are sensitive to India, the offer is mostly a tariff-rate quota (TRQ) based tariff liberalization. To safeguard its interest, sensitive products have been kept in the exclusion category by India without offering any concessions, especially agricultural products, including dairy, tea, coffee, rubber, and tobacco products; gold and silver bullion, jewellery; other labour-intensive products such as footwear, sports goods; and scrap of many base metals. The Services sector, a strong driver of India’s economy, will also see wide-ranging benefits. Oman’s substantial global services imports amounting to USD 12.52 billion, with the share of India's exports in Oman's global imports basket as 5.31%, indicating significant untapped potential for Indian service providers. The agreement features a comprehensive and forward-looking services package, with Oman extending substantial commitments across a broad spectrum of sectors including Computer Related Services, Business and Professional Services, Audio-visual Services, Research and Development, Education and Health Services. These commitments are expected to unlock significant new opportunities for Indian service providers, promote high-value job creation, and support expanding commercial engagement between the two countries. A major highlight of the CEPA is the enhanced mobility framework for Indian professionals. For the first time, Oman has offered wide-ranging commitments under Mode 4, including a notable increase in the quota for Intra-Corporate Transferees from 20 per cent to 50 per cent, together with a longer permitted duration of stay for Contractual Service Suppliers—extended from the existing 90 days to two years, with the possibility of a further two-year extension. The agreement also provides for more liberal entry and stay conditions for skilled professionals in key sectors such as accountancy, taxation, architecture, medical and allied services, supporting deeper and more seamless professional engagement. The CEPA further provides for 100 per cent Foreign Direct Investment by Indian companies in major services sectors in Oman through commercial presence, opening a wide avenue for India’s services industry to expand operations in the region. In addition, both sides have agreed to hold future discussions on social security coordination once Oman’s contributory social security system is implemented, reflecting a forward-looking approach to facilitating labour mobility and worker protection. A landmark element of the Agreement is Oman’s commitment on Traditional Medicine extended across all modes of supply representing the first such comprehensive commitment made by any country, and creating a significant opportunity for India’s AYUSH and wellness sectors to showcase its strength in the Gulf region. Apart from the above, provisions in CEPA also address non-tariff barriers persisting despite tariff concessions, limiting real market access. This is the first bilateral agreement that Oman has signed with any country since United States of America in 2006. Union Minister for Commerce and Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal, expressed profound gratitude to Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi for his visionary guidance, stating: “The India-Oman CEPA strengthens the historical strong ties of India with Oman and signifies an ambitious and balanced economic framework that significantly enhances opportunities for Indian exporters and professionals. It unlocks nearly universal duty free access for Indian goods in the Omani market, expands services commitments across key high growth sectors, and ensures greater mobility for Indian professionals. The agreement reinforces India’s commitment to inclusive growth benefiting farmers, artisans, workers, MSMEs while safeguarding core national interests.” The CEPA is expected to significantly boost bilateral trade, generate employment, expand exports, strengthen supply chains, and open new avenues for deeper, long-term economic engagement between India and Oman.

                        18 DEC 2025 3:53PM by PIB Delhi India and Oman have taken a significant step in building a stronger economic partnership with the signing of Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement today under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. Commerce and Industry Minister Shri Piyush Goyal and Oman’s Minister of Commerce, Industry & Investment Promotion H.E. Qais bin Mohammed Al Yousef signed the agreement. This Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) marks an important milestone in India’s engagement with the Gulf region and reflects the shared commitment to deepen bilateral economic integration. Oman is an important strategic partner in the region and is a key gateway for Indian goods and services to the wider Middle East and Africa. Nearly 7 lakh Indian nationals reside in Oman, including Indian merchant families with a presence of over 200–300 years, contributing significantly to Oman’s economy and society. Indian enterprises have built a strong presence in Oman, with over 6,000 Indian establishments operating across sectors. Annual remittances of around USD 2 billion further reflect the depth of economic engagement. Bilateral trade between India and Oman stands at over USD 10 billion, with strong potential for expansion under the CEPA framework. This is the 2nd Free Trade Agreement signed in the last 6 months after United Kingdom and is a part of strategy to sign trade agreements with developed economies that are not competing with our labour-intensive interests and provide opportunities for Indian businesses. The CEPA secures unprecedented tariff concessions for India from Oman. Oman has offered zero-duty access on 98.08% of its tariff lines, covering 99.38% of India’s exports to Oman. All major labour-intensive sectors including Gems & Jewellery, Textiles, leather, footwear, sports goods, plastics, furniture, agricultural products, engineering products, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and Automobiles receive full tariff elimination.  Out of the above, immediate tariff elimination is being offered on 97.96% Tariff Lines. India is offering tariff liberalization on 77.79% of its total tariff lines (12556) which covers 94.81% of India’s imports from Oman by value. For the products of export interest to Oman and which are sensitive to India, the offer is mostly a tariff-rate quota (TRQ) based tariff liberalization. To safeguard its interest, sensitive products have been kept in the exclusion category by India without offering any concessions, especially agricultural products, including dairy, tea, coffee, rubber, and tobacco products; gold and silver bullion, jewellery; other labour-intensive products such as footwear, sports goods; and scrap of many base metals. The Services sector, a strong driver of India’s economy, will also see wide-ranging benefits. Oman’s substantial global services imports amounting to USD 12.52 billion, with the share of India's exports in Oman's global imports basket as 5.31%, indicating significant untapped potential for Indian service providers. The agreement features a comprehensive and forward-looking services package, with Oman extending substantial commitments across a broad spectrum of sectors including Computer Related Services, Business and Professional Services, Audio-visual Services, Research and Development, Education and Health Services. These commitments are expected to unlock significant new opportunities for Indian service providers, promote high-value job creation, and support expanding commercial engagement between the two countries. A major highlight of the CEPA is the enhanced mobility framework for Indian professionals. For the first time, Oman has offered wide-ranging commitments under Mode 4, including a notable increase in the quota for Intra-Corporate Transferees from 20 per cent to 50 per cent, together with a longer permitted duration of stay for Contractual Service Suppliers—extended from the existing 90 days to two years, with the possibility of a further two-year extension. The agreement also provides for more liberal entry and stay conditions for skilled professionals in key sectors such as accountancy, taxation, architecture, medical and allied services, supporting deeper and more seamless professional engagement. The CEPA further provides for 100 per cent Foreign Direct Investment by Indian companies in major services sectors in Oman through commercial presence, opening a wide avenue for India’s services industry to expand operations in the region. In addition, both sides have agreed to hold future discussions on social security coordination once Oman’s contributory social security system is implemented, reflecting a forward-looking approach to facilitating labour mobility and worker protection. A landmark element of the Agreement is Oman’s commitment on Traditional Medicine extended across all modes of supply representing the first such comprehensive commitment made by any country, and creating a significant opportunity for India’s AYUSH and wellness sectors to showcase its strength in the Gulf region. Apart from the above, provisions in CEPA also address non-tariff barriers persisting despite tariff concessions, limiting real market access. This is the first bilateral agreement that Oman has signed with any country since United States of America in 2006. Union Minister for Commerce and Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal, expressed profound gratitude to Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi for his visionary guidance, stating: “The India-Oman CEPA strengthens the historical strong ties of India with Oman and signifies an ambitious and balanced economic framework that significantly enhances opportunities for Indian exporters and professionals. It unlocks nearly universal duty free access for Indian goods in the Omani market, expands services commitments across key high growth sectors, and ensures greater mobility for Indian professionals. The agreement reinforces India’s commitment to inclusive growth benefiting farmers, artisans, workers, MSMEs while safeguarding core national interests.” The CEPA is expected to significantly boost bilateral trade, generate employment, expand exports, strengthen supply chains, and open new avenues for deeper, long-term economic engagement between India and Oman. Under the leadership of Prime Minister @NarendraModi ji and His Majesty Sultan Haitham bin Tarik, India and Oman have inked the India-Oman Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), marking a significant milestone in India's strategic engagement with the Gulf region.… pic.twitter.com/VI2RzSpO2O — Piyush Goyal (@PiyushGoyal) December 18, 2025 *** Abhishek Dayal/ Shabbir Azad (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205889)","2025-12-18T17:48:51.807769"

                18 DEC 2025 8:57PM by PIB Delhi Jammu and Kashmir is not merely a region endowed with natural beauty; since ancient times it has also been a center of India’s cultural, spiritual, and philosophical consciousness. This core idea was highlighted through the launch of an important film and coffee table book titled ‘Sanskriti Jammu & Kashmir’, held at the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA). The program was organized by the Media Centre of IGNCA. The film has been produced by IGNCA. The writer and co-producer of the film is Mr. Rajan Khanna, while the director and editor is Shivansh Khanna. The program was presided over by Dr. Sachchidanand Joshi, Member Secretary of IGNCA. On this occasion, senior writer and broadcaster Mr. Gaurishankar Raina, the film’s writer Mr. Rajan Khanna, and Controller of the Media Centre Mr. Anurag Punetha were present. A meaningful panel discussion on ‘Sanskriti Jammu & Kashmir’ was also held, in which Dr. Sachchidanand Joshi, Mr. Rajan Khanna, and Mr. Gaurishankar Raina shared their views. Dr. Sachchidanand Joshi said that shooting at the locations featured in 'Sanskriti Jammu & Kashmir' was not easy, as these areas are not only geographically difficult but have also become very hard to access in recent times. Photographs of some of these places are rarely seen. The film includes footage shot at such rare locations. Speaking about the significance of the film, he said that amid continuous attempts to distort and destroy history and to erase our traditional beliefs, this film will stand like a lighthouse. It will illuminate what our traditions are and what our history is. Through this film, many young people—who may not know the real history of Jammu and Kashmir but wish to understand it—can certainly be connected. Towards the end, he also requested the film’s director Shivansh Khanna to disseminate some powerful shots and visuals of important temples through short reels. This would attract people to watch the full film and also help in its wider promotion. The film’s writer Rajan Khanna said that just as there is a relationship between body and soul, there is also a relationship between nation, culture, and geography. The body is perishable, but the nation and culture are eternal. India is like a bouquet of flowers, and among them, the culture of Jammu and Kashmir is a distinct flower—one that embodies spirituality, history, and thought. When one visits the region, it is not just about visiting temples; the hymns of the Vedas, which form the foundation of Indian culture, are inscribed there, and their complete philosophy can be experienced. The vision of the great culture created by our ancestors is clearly visible in Jammu and Kashmir. He further said that whenever Kashmir is mentioned, discussions often revolve around terrorism, jihad, or organizations such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. But when Kashmir is discussed, why is there no mention of its 10,000-year-old history? Why is there no discussion about Anantnag, considered one of the world’s most ancient cities? Why is Kashmir’s history limited only to the period from 1339 to 1819? Kashmir’s history is also connected to the Rigveda. If we do not re-establish our civilizational foundation ourselves, whom will we blame? Even the future will not forgive us. Mr. Gaurishankar Raina said that making such a film is extremely challenging. He has personally gone through this process and knows that it is not easy—especially making films on temples, which requires multiple permissions and access to places that are often difficult to reach. There are many hardships involved. He added that the research associated with such films is also very time-consuming and labor-intensive. Today is the age of electronic and digital media, and in such times, film is an extremely important medium through which one can convey meaningful narratives. Earlier, in his inaugural address, Mr. Anurag Punetha said that whenever a film is made that documents something from a historical and cultural perspective, it performs a very significant task. Especially at a time when, for the last three or four decades, Kashmir has been primarily portrayed as a conflict zone, it is very important—through IGNCA and the visual medium of film—to convey to the country that Jammu and Kashmir has a rich cultural heritage, which still exists today. Its architecture remains an integral part of our collective memory. A society that forgets its heritage while remembering everything else faces a serious crisis. This film is a modest attempt to bring that memory back before everyone. Mr. Punetha concluded by expressing his gratitude to the speakers, guests, and attendees. The program was moderated by Narendra Singh from the Media Centre. *About the Film* The film 'Sanskriti: Jammu & Kashmir’ is set against the breathtaking landscapes of Jammu and Kashmir. It begins with a calm and profound remembrance of the region’s ancient spiritual consciousness—of a land that historian Kalhana once described in his 'Rajatarangini' as being adorned with countless temples. Even today, some of these temples stand in their dignified presence, while many others remain as ruins—silent witnesses to the passage of time and historical upheavals. Through vivid and impactful visuals, the film brings forth the efforts made by Sikh and Dogra rulers to revive temples and religious sites. It also highlights the philosophical and intellectual legacy of the Fourth Buddhist Council held at Harwan Monastery in Srinagar, as well as the Sikh tradition associated with the visit of Guru Hargobind Ji. The film sheds light on lesser-known spiritual traditions of the Jammu and Kashmir region that have largely remained neglected—from the ancient Mamleshwar Temple in Pahalgam to the forgotten shrines around Gulmarg and the historic temples of Jammu. ‘Sanskriti: Jammu & Kashmir’ emerges as a cinematic rediscovery, inviting viewers to reconnect with a long-suppressed cultural and spiritual narrative. The film introduces audiences to a land where every stone carries within it the weight of memory, devotion, and cultural continuity. ***** Sunil Kumar Tiwari pibculture[at]gmail[dot]com (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2206275) आगंतुक पटल  : 73 Ministry of Culture ‘Sanskriti Jammu & Kashmir’ stands like a lighthouse amid continuous attempts to destroy traditions: Dr. Sachchidanand Joshi Kashmir is the land of the Rigveda : Rajan Khanna प्रविष्टि तिथि:
                        18 DEC 2025 8:57PM by PIB Delhi Jammu and Kashmir is not merely a region endowed with natural beauty; since ancient times it has also been a center of India’s cultural, spiritual, and philosophical consciousness. This core idea was highlighted through the launch of an important film and coffee table book titled ‘Sanskriti Jammu & Kashmir’, held at the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA). The program was organized by the Media Centre of IGNCA. The film has been produced by IGNCA. The writer and co-producer of the film is Mr. Rajan Khanna, while the director and editor is Shivansh Khanna. The program was presided over by Dr. Sachchidanand Joshi, Member Secretary of IGNCA. On this occasion, senior writer and broadcaster Mr. Gaurishankar Raina, the film’s writer Mr. Rajan Khanna, and Controller of the Media Centre Mr. Anurag Punetha were present. A meaningful panel discussion on ‘Sanskriti Jammu & Kashmir’ was also held, in which Dr. Sachchidanand Joshi, Mr. Rajan Khanna, and Mr. Gaurishankar Raina shared their views. Dr. Sachchidanand Joshi said that shooting at the locations featured in 'Sanskriti Jammu & Kashmir' was not easy, as these areas are not only geographically difficult but have also become very hard to access in recent times. Photographs of some of these places are rarely seen. The film includes footage shot at such rare locations. Speaking about the significance of the film, he said that amid continuous attempts to distort and destroy history and to erase our traditional beliefs, this film will stand like a lighthouse. It will illuminate what our traditions are and what our history is. Through this film, many young people—who may not know the real history of Jammu and Kashmir but wish to understand it—can certainly be connected. Towards the end, he also requested the film’s director Shivansh Khanna to disseminate some powerful shots and visuals of important temples through short reels. This would attract people to watch the full film and also help in its wider promotion. The film’s writer Rajan Khanna said that just as there is a relationship between body and soul, there is also a relationship between nation, culture, and geography. The body is perishable, but the nation and culture are eternal. India is like a bouquet of flowers, and among them, the culture of Jammu and Kashmir is a distinct flower—one that embodies spirituality, history, and thought. When one visits the region, it is not just about visiting temples; the hymns of the Vedas, which form the foundation of Indian culture, are inscribed there, and their complete philosophy can be experienced. The vision of the great culture created by our ancestors is clearly visible in Jammu and Kashmir. He further said that whenever Kashmir is mentioned, discussions often revolve around terrorism, jihad, or organizations such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. But when Kashmir is discussed, why is there no mention of its 10,000-year-old history? Why is there no discussion about Anantnag, considered one of the world’s most ancient cities? Why is Kashmir’s history limited only to the period from 1339 to 1819? Kashmir’s history is also connected to the Rigveda. If we do not re-establish our civilizational foundation ourselves, whom will we blame? Even the future will not forgive us. Mr. Gaurishankar Raina said that making such a film is extremely challenging. He has personally gone through this process and knows that it is not easy—especially making films on temples, which requires multiple permissions and access to places that are often difficult to reach. There are many hardships involved. He added that the research associated with such films is also very time-consuming and labor-intensive. Today is the age of electronic and digital media, and in such times, film is an extremely important medium through which one can convey meaningful narratives. Earlier, in his inaugural address, Mr. Anurag Punetha said that whenever a film is made that documents something from a historical and cultural perspective, it performs a very significant task. Especially at a time when, for the last three or four decades, Kashmir has been primarily portrayed as a conflict zone, it is very important—through IGNCA and the visual medium of film—to convey to the country that Jammu and Kashmir has a rich cultural heritage, which still exists today. Its architecture remains an integral part of our collective memory. A society that forgets its heritage while remembering everything else faces a serious crisis. This film is a modest attempt to bring that memory back before everyone. Mr. Punetha concluded by expressing his gratitude to the speakers, guests, and attendees.

The meeting saw participation from Dr. Sukanta Majumdar, the Hon’ble Minister of State of MDoNER; Secretary, MDoNER; and other senior officers of MDoNER and the State Government. The meeting reviewed the overall approach to developing the Matabari circuit as a model tourism destination and placed strong emphasis on capacity building, ensuring that local people are meaningfully engaged and motivated by the opportunities created through tourism, particularly in terms of sustained livelihoods. Shri Scindia stressed that historians of Tripura should also be actively involved in the tourism ecosystem and engaged in training tourist guides and assistants to impart authentic knowledge of the State’s history. This process should be institutionalised, blending traditional knowledge with modern training practices. The discussions highlighted that the beauty of Tripura lies in keeping history alive in its antiquity with a modern setting, adopting an organic and natural approach. Development under the Matabari circuit should visibly reflect the history of Tripura, ensuring that soft aesthetics are maintained. Emphasis was laid on promoting local Tripura cuisine as an integral part of the visitor experience. It was further noted that the tourism circuit should also include a high-end, niche component, encouraging participation from major hospitality players. Niche and high-end part of the circuit should be blended with the mass circuit to exploit maximum benefit. The Hon’ble Tourism Minister of Tripura was advised to take this forward as a guidance model, positioning the Matabari circuit as a benchmark not only for the North Eastern Region, but for tourism development across India.

                18 DEC 2025 3:42PM by PIB Delhi The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has identified areas vulnerable to various weather hazards, including extreme rainfall, snowfall, hailstorms, thunderstorms, etc. The list of districts vulnerable to heavy rainfall & floods, snowfall, etc., including that from the state of Himachal Pradesh is given in Annexure-1. The Government has been working to strengthen real-time monitoring systems, early warning systems, and sensor-based technology to detect, monitor, and provide timely early warnings for all types of severe weather events. Major progress and achievements are given in Annexure-2. In recent years, the observational infrastructure and monitoring network over hilly regions has been significantly strengthened. In the western Himalayan States, Doppler Weather Radars (DWRs) have been installed at ten locations—Srinagar, Jammu, Banihal Top, Mukteshwar, Surkanda Devi, Lansdowne, Leh, Kufri, Jot, and Murari Devi. These radars are operational and support real-time monitoring and nowcasting (short-range forecasts of a few hours) of various extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall and snowfall. DWR observations are available every ten minutes in the form of cloud imagery and wind velocity measurements within the radar's coverage area. These observations support continuous monitoring and enable the issuance of nowcasts of heavy rainfall spells within short time frames (up to one hour). A new Central Sector Scheme ""Mission Mausam"" has been also launched by MoES to further strengthen and upgrade the observational network for monitoring and forecasting severe weather events, with the goal of making Bharat a ""Weather-ready and Climate- smart"" nation with IMD as a major player. ***** NKR/AK Annexure-1 The list of districts vulnerable to various weather-related hazards: State Name Districts Hazards HIMACHAL PRADESH BILASPUR, UNA, SIRMAUR, HAMIRPUR, SOLAN, MANDI, KANGRA, KULLU, CHAMBA, SHIMLA KINNAUR, LAHUL & SPITI Snowfall events JAMMU AND KASHMIR (UT) MUZAFFARABAD, MIRPUR, SAMBA, KATHUA, JAMMU, REASI, UDHAMPUR, RAJOURI BADGAM, KULGAM, DODA, SHUPIYAN, KISHTWAR, PULWAMA, PUNCH, GANDERBAL, BANDIPORE, RAMBAN, ANANTNAG, SRINAGAR, BARAMULA, KUPWARA UTTARAKHAND UDHAM SINGH NAGAR, NAINITAL, CHAMPAWAT, BAGESHWAR, UTTARKASHI, PITHORAGARH, HARIDWAR, TEHRI GARHWAL, RUDRAPRAYAG, ALMORA, PAURI GARHWAL, CHAMOLI, DEHRADUN HIMACHAL PRADESH BILASPUR, UNA, SIRMAUR, HAMIRPUR, SOLAN, MANDI, KANGRA, KULLU, CHAMBA, SHIMLA, KINNAUR, LAHUL & SPITI Cold Wave JAMMU AND KASHMIR (UT) KUPWARA,           BANDIPORE,                                 BARAMULA, GANDERBAL, ANANTNAG, KISHTWAR, SRINAGAR, BADGAM, PULWAMA, PUNCH, SHUPIYAN, KULGAM, RAJOURI, RAMBAN, REASI, DODA, JAMMU, KATHUA, UDHAMPUR, SAMBA, MUZAFFARABAD, MIRPUR UTTARAKHAND ALMORA, BAGESHWAR, CHAMOLI, CHAMPAWAT, DEHRADUN, HARIDWAR, NAINITAL, PAURI GARHWAL, PITHORAGARH, RUDRAPRAYAG, TEHRI GARHWAL, UDHAM SINGH NAGAR, UTTARKASHI HIMACHAL PRADESH BILASPUR, UNA, SIRMAUR, HAMIRPUR, SOLAN, MANDI, KANGRA, KULLU, CHAMBA, SHIMLA, KINNAUR, LAHUL & SPITI Thunderst orm JAMMU AND KASHMIR (UT) KATHUA,          KUPWARA,                            MUZAFFARABAD, KISHTWAR, BANDIPORE, MIRPUR, DODA, PUNCH, BARAMULA, UDHAMPUR, GANDERBAL, RAJOURI, BADGAM, SHUPIYAN, SRINAGAR, ANANTNAG, PULWAMA, REASI, KULGAM, RAMBAN, SAMBA, JAMMU UTTARAKHAND UDHAM SINGH NAGAR, PITHORAGARH, HARIDWAR, PAURI GARHWAL, CHAMPAWAT, BAGESHWAR, CHAMOLI, NAINITAL, ALMORA, RUDRAPRAYAG, UTTARKASHI, DEHRADUN, TEHRI GARHWAL HIMACHAL PRADESH BILASPUR,  UNA,   SIRMAUR,  HAMIRPUR,                   SOLAN, MANDI,         KANGRA,                      KULLU,       CHAMBA,                  SHIMLA, KINNAUR, LAHUL & SPITI Lightning JAMMU AND KASHMIR (UT) KUPWARA, RAJOURI, JAMMU, BARAMULA UTTARAKHA ND NAINITAL, PAURI, GARHWAL, UTTARKASHI, DEHRADUN, HARIDWAR, CHAMPAWAT, CHAMOLI, UDHAM SINGH NAGAR, ALMORA, RUDRAPRAYAG, BAGESHWAR, PITHORAGARH HIMACHAL PRADESH LAHUL & SPITI, BILASPUR, UNA, SIRMAUR, KINNAUR, CHAMBA, SOLAN,          HAMIRPUR,                      MANDI,   KULLU, KANGRA, SHIMLA Flood JAMMU AND KASHMIR (UT) KULGAM, BANDIPORE, SHUPIYAN, MUZAFFARABAD, GANDERBAL, KISHTWAR, KUPWARA, MIRPUR, SAMBA, BADGAM, RAMBAN, UDHAMPUR, ANANTNAG, KATHUA, RAJOURI, BARAMULA, PUNCH, PULWAMA, REASI, DODA, SRINAGAR, JAMMU UTTARAKHA ND BAGESHWAR,        HARIDWAR,                                  RUDRAPRAYAG, CHAMPAWAT, UDHAM SINGH NAGAR, ALMORA, DEHRADUN, NAINITAL, UTTARKASHI, PAURI, GARHWAL, TEHRI, GARHWAL, CHAMOLI, PITHORAGARH ANNEXURE-2 Major targets achieved in recent years by IMD are as follows: Expansion of the Doppler Weather Radar (DWR) network from 15 in 2014 to 47.

                18 DEC 2025 3:41PM by PIB Delhi India Meteorological Department (IMD) has been providing various climate-related services to the country since 1985, through its Pune Office. The National Climate Centre was created within this Office in 2005, which gained international responsibilities of a Regional Climate Centre for RA II (region South Asia) in 2010. The formal establishment of a specialized climate service by IMD was however started in 2017, when the Pune office was again re-designated as the Office of Climate Research and Services (CRS). Currently, the CRS office has been carrying out many India-specific climate-related activities like Climate Monitoring and Analysis, Climate Data Management, Climate Research, and Climate Prediction (Seasonal Forecasts). The CRS Office is bringing out climate diagnostic bulletins regularly, and different climate data products are prepared for the user community. Operational Seasonal forecasts for the country as well as South Asia is another important activity of this Office. CRS Office is also working as the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recognised Regional Climate Centre (RCC) for Pune since 2016 and the Global Production Centre (GPC) of Long-Range Forecasting since 2023. Recently, the IMD has also initiated the establishment of the National Framework for Climate Services (NFCS) in alignment with the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS) of the World Meteorological Organization. A stakeholder consultation workshop on the NFCS was organised by IMD on 5–6 October 2023 as a part of the implementation of the National Framework of Climate Services, which is supported by a broad network of collaborating institutions, including the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)/State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), State Governments, urban local bodies, and various research and academic organizations. During the workshop, participants from several ministries and user sectors unanimously agreed to establish a formal mechanism based on the NFCS concept, suitably adapted for the Indian context. This will strengthen responsibility-sharing and operational coordination among agencies serving climate-sensitive sectors. NFCS aims to develop and deliver tailored climate information and services to support decision-making in key climate-sensitive sectors. To further advance weather and climate services in India, IMD has also conducted multiple state-level stakeholder consultation workshops with various State Government departments. These engagements included users from agriculture, water resources, energy, disaster management, transport, aviation, media, health, urban planning, and local communities. The discussions helped identify practical gaps, emerging needs, and opportunities to improve the usability, accessibility, and reach of weather and climate services across the country. The weather and climate modelling systems implemented under the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) significantly contribute to improving forecasting capabilities across different time scales. Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, high-resolution regional models, and coupled ocean–atmosphere climate models enhance short-range to seasonal forecasting of rainfall, monsoon variability, cyclones, heatwaves, cold waves, and extreme weather events. Advanced data assimilation systems, supported by satellite and ground-based observations, improve the initial conditions of models, thereby enhancing forecast accuracy. The use of high-performance computing systems, ensemble prediction techniques, and impact-based forecasting frameworks has strengthened the country's ability to provide more reliable and actionable weather and climate forecasts to various sectors and user groups. There has been tremendous progress in modernising IMD's observational system with the installation of new Doppler Weather Radars (DWRs), lightning alert systems, and automated weather stations across the country. Presently, a total of 47 DWRs are installed and operational in India compared to 14 DWRs in 2014. There are 104 locations having a Lightning detection System across India, which are fully operational with lightning alert dissemination through the Damini App. Under the Mission Mausam, the Bharat Forecast System (BharatFS), an advanced computer simulation model, has already been developed, and it has been operational at a very high spatial resolution of 6 km. It also has the capability to provide predictions of rainfall events up to 10 days, covering the short and medium-range forecasts. Due to its higher resolution and improved dynamics, it generates weather forecasts at the panchayat or cluster of panchayats level. To further support the operations of high-resolution model simulations in real-time, the computing facilities (Arunika and Arka) have been substantially increased to integrate voluminous data and run meso-scale, regional, and global models. The India Meteorological Department has taken significant steps to enhance training, strengthen international cooperation, and expand awareness activities for improved climate and weather services. IMD actively collaborates with global and regional agencies—including WMO, WHO, UKMO, RIMES, UNESCAP, and all South Asian countries—to advance climate services in India and contribute to the regional climate services framework. IMD experts participate in several high-level international committees such as the WMO Task Team on the National Framework for Climate Services (TT-NFCS), the Climate Services Working Group of the South Asian Hydromet Forum (SAHF), and CLIVAR scientific panels, ensuring India's strong presence in global climate service development and international cooperation. Capacity building is further strengthened through numerous international training programmes conducted by IMD's Meteorological Training Institute (MTI), which regularly hosts participants from developing and neighbouring countries. These combined efforts are substantially contributing to more robust climate services, improved early warning capabilities, and better-informed decision-making across sectors in India. ***** NKR/AK (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205867) आगंतुक पटल  : 75 इस विज्ञप्ति को इन भाषाओं में पढ़ें: हिन्दी Ministry of Earth Sciences PARLIAMENT QUESTION: IMPROVING CLIMATE AND WEATHER SERVICES प्रविष्टि तिथि:

                18 DEC 2025 3:39PM by PIB Delhi The IMD’s seasonal forecast for the 2024 & 2025 southwest monsoon seasons proved to be highly accurate. The details of IMD seasonal forecast verification for All India Summer Monsoon Rainfall for the period 2024 & 2025 is given below: Year All India Summer Monsoon Rainfall Forecast Verification Actual (%) First Forecast (%) Second Stage Forecast (%) Rainfall Category Remark 2024 108 106 106 Above Normal Accurate 2025 108 105 106 Above Normal Accurate *Model error ± 5% of LPA for 1 st stage **Model error ± 4% of LPA for 2 nd stage For the 2024 southwest monsoon season, the first stage forecast for the season (June- September) rainfall over the country as a whole issued in April was 106% of LPA with a model error of ± 5% of LPA, and the update forecast issued in the end of May 2024 was 106% of LPA with a model error of ± 4% of LPA. The actual season rainfall for the country as a whole was 108 % of LPA. Thus, the seasonal rainfall forecast for the country as a whole was correct. Considering the four broad geographical regions of India, the forecasts issued on 27th May 2024 indicated that the southwest monsoon seasonal (June to September 2024) rainfall is most likely to be above-normal over Central India and South Peninsular India (>106% of LPA), normal over Northwest India (92-108% of LPA) and below normal over Northeast India (<94% of LPA). The forecast for the southwest monsoon seasonal rainfall over the monsoon core zone, consisting of most of the rainfed agriculture, was also above Normal (>106% of LPA. The actual rainfall over Northwest India, Central India, Northeast India, South Peninsula, and Monsoon Core Zone was recorded at 107%, 120%, 86%, 114% and 119% of the LPA, respectively. The seasonal forecast issued for homogeneous regions during the season was within the range of the forecast for all four regions. The first stage forecast for the 2025 southwest monsoon season (June-September) rainfall over the country as a whole issued in April was 105% of LPA with a model error of ± 5% of LPA, and the update forecast issued at the end of 5th May 2025 was 106% of LPA with a model error of ± 4% of LPA. The actual season rainfall for the country as a whole was 108 % of LPA. Thus, the seasonal rainfall forecast for the country as a whole was correct. Considering the four broad geographical regions of India, the forecasts issued on 27th May, the southwest monsoon seasonal (June to September 2025) rainfall is most likely to be above-normal over Central India and South Peninsular India (>106% of LPA), above normal over Northwest India (>108% of LPA) and below normal over Northeast India (106% of LPA). The actual rainfall over Northwest India, Central India, Northeast India, South Peninsula, and Monsoon Core Zone were 27%, 15%, -20%, 10% and 22% of the LPA, respectively. The seasonal forecast issued for homogeneous regions during the season was within the range of the forecast, except for Northwest India. The spatial probability forecasts during both years had also indicated, highlighted above-normal rainfall across the country, except in Northeast India. Overall, the forecast aligned well with observed rainfall patterns across much of India, with only a few deviations noted in parts of the Gangetic Plains. Monsoon rains are critical for the agricultural sector, particularly over the monsoon core zone, consisting of most of the rainfed agriculture areas in the country. However, over most areas of the monsoon core zone received normal to above normal rainfall during both years. In 2024, annual crop production in the country was above normal, and during 2025, the annual crop production is expected to be above normal. IMD is continuously working on upgrading and improving its seasonal prediction systems through advances in empirical, dynamical, and multi-model ensemble-based approaches. Ongoing enhancements focus on refining model physics, improving data assimilation, increasing model resolution, integrating more robust ensemble techniques, and using AI/ML to deliver more accurate and reliable seasonal forecasts. Various steps have been taken by the Government to strengthen IMD's data network, and there has been tremendous progress in modernising IMD's observational system with the installation of new Doppler Weather Radars (DWR), lightning alert systems, and automated weather stations across the country.

                18 DEC 2025 5:15PM by PIB Delhi The Sabka Bima Sabki Raksha (Amendment of Insurance Laws) Bill, 2025 has been passed by Parliament on 17.12.2025. The bill amends three Acts related to Insurance sector, namely, The Insurance Act,1938, The Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956 and The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority Act, 1999. One of the key features of the bill is to allow up to 100% Foreign Direct Investment in Insurance Companies, opening doors to more foreign players to India.  This will help in capital augmentation, adoption of advanced technology and bringing global best practices along with increasing employment opportunities.  Increased competition would drive efficiency in products and services proving beneficial for the citizens. Ease of Doing business is being promoted for intermediaries through the introduction of provision of one-time licensing and the provision of suspension of license rather than straight away cancellation. For insurers, the limit of seeking prior regulatory approval for transfer of share capital has been raised from 1% to 5%, the Net Owned Fund requirement of Foreign Reinsurance Branches has been reduced from Rs 5,000 Crore to Rs 1,000 Crore.  LIC has been provided autonomy to open Zonal offices in the country and to align its foreign offices with the laws and regulations of their respective jurisdiction. To protect the interest of Policyholders, a dedicated fund, namely Policyholders’ Education and Protection Fund will be set up to spread awareness about insurance. Policyholders’ data would now be required to be collected and protected in alignment with DPDP Act 2023. Regulatory governance is being strengthened by introducing standard operating procedure for regulation making and mandating the process consultative.  IRDAI is being given the power to disgorge wrongful gains from insurers and intermediaries. Penalties are being rationalised and factors for imposition of penalties are being introduced. The reforms are aimed at extending insurance coverage to people, households and enterprises, deepening insurance coverage, providing ease of doing business, improving regulatory oversight and governance. All these measures would lead to strengthening of Indian insurance sector to provide financial resilience to Indian economy. ***** NB/PK (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2206011) आगंतुक पटल  : 497 इस विज्ञप्ति को इन भाषाओं में पढ़ें: Khasi , Urdu , हिन्दी , Gujarati , Odia , Malayalam Ministry of Finance The Sabka Bima Sabki Raksha (Amendment of Insurance Laws) Bill, 2025 passed by Parliament; allows up to 100% FDI in insurance companies The Bill to deepen insurance coverage, provide ease of doing business and improve regulatory oversight and governance Capital augmentation, adoption of advanced technology and global best practices in insurance sector to be leveraged Increased competition to drive efficiency in products and services for citizens Net Owned Fund requirement of Foreign Reinsurance Branches reduced from 5,000 Cr to 1,000 Cr Policyholders’ Education and Protection Fund, a dedicated fund to spread awareness about insurance amongst policyholders प्रविष्टि तिथि:

                18 DEC 2025 7:43PM by PIB Delhi Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare, Shri JP Nadda, today convened a meeting with Members of Parliament from Madhya Pradesh as part of a series of focused, state-wise interactions aimed at accelerating the TB Mukt Bharat Abhiyan. The engagement is part of ongoing dialogues with parliamentarians across States, following similar meetings held earlier this month, with MPs from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. The interaction, held under the theme “Parliamentarians Championing a TB Mukt Bharat”, at Madhya Pradesh Bhawan underscored the critical role of elected representatives in driving constituency-level action and fostering cross-party collaboration to achieve the national goal of TB elimination. Today’s session also witnessed the presence of Union Minister for Communications and Development of North Eastern Region Shri Jyotiraditya M. Scindia, Union Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare Smt. Anupriya Patel and Union Minister of State for Tribal Affairs Shri Durgadas Uikey along with the parliamentarians from the state. Addressing the MPs, Shri Nadda highlighted India’s significant progress in the fight against tuberculosis. Citing the WHO Global TB Report 2025, she noted a 21% reduction in TB incidence between 2015 and 2024, nearly double the global average decline, alongside a 25% reduction in TB-related mortality. India has also achieved a 90% treatment success rate, surpassing the global average of 88%. He credited these gains to sustained political leadership, robust programme implementation, and strong Jan Bhagidari, positioning India as a global leader in TB elimination efforts. Reiterating that Jan Andolan remains the cornerstone of India’s TB elimination strategy, Shri Nadda urged MPs to continue mobilising communities in their constituencies, strengthen awareness, and ensure comprehensive psychosocial support for patients and their families. Commending Madhya Pradesh for its proactive approach, the Union Minister of State for Health Smt. Anupriya Patel acknowledged the State’s intensified community-based screening efforts, including in tribal and hard-to-reach areas. She noted that increased TB notifications reflect improved programme outreach and enhanced collaboration with the private healthcare sector. The Minister also highlighted the scale-up of advanced diagnostic tools such as AI-enabled chest X-rays, mobile diagnostic vans and NAAT machines, as well as the enhanced ₹1,000 monthly nutritional support being provided to TB patients under the Ni-kshay Poshan Yojana, contributing to improved treatment outcomes. The Additional Secretary and Mission Director, National Health Mission, Smt. Aradhana Patnaik highlighted India’s innovative and patient-centric TB elimination framework, noting that the country’s extensive diagnostic infrastructure now includes over 9,300 NAAT machines, ensuring coverage across all blocks nationwide. She also underscored the global recognition India has received for its sustained progress against TB. She presented a detailed overview of Madhya Pradesh’s performance on key indicators, including screening of vulnerable populations, case notifications, treatment success rates, and nutritional support coverage.

                18 DEC 2025 5:49PM by PIB Delhi Water being a State subject, the aspects related to water resources including its conservation are studied, planned, funded and executed by the State Governments themselves as per their own resources and priorities. The Central Government supplements the measures and efforts being taken up by the State Governments. The Government of India takes various initiatives on water conservation to ensure the long-term sustainability of water conservation. Major steps taken by the Government for water conservation and rainwater harvesting across the country including the states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and UT of Dadra and Nagar Haveli: The Ministry of Jal Shakti has been implementing Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) since 2019 across the country including the states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and UT of Dadra and Nagar Haveli. JSA: CTR has become a regular feature since 2021, with its sixth edition is implemented in all the districts (rural as well as urban) of the country from 22.03.2025 to 30.11.2025 under the theme “Jal Sanchay, Jan Bhagidari: Jan Jagrukta Ki Or”, emphasizing community participation and water conservation awareness. The campaign emphasizes convergent financing from various schemes of the Central, State and local bodies like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), Per Drop More Crop, Repair, Renovation and Restoration Components under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY), Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA), Finance Commission grants etc. Under the Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain (JSA: CTR) campaign, Khandwa district has completed more than 7,000 water conservation and water-related works during the last three years. The district has also established a Jal Shakti Kendra and prepared a District Water Conservation Plan. Further, the district wise details of the water conservation initiatives undertaken under the Jal Shakti Abhiyan in the states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and UT of Dadra and Nagar Haveli during the last three years are given at Annexures I, II and III respectively. To further deepen public involvement, ""Jal Sanchay Jan Bhagidari"" (JSJB) initiative was launched in Surat, Gujarat on 6th September 2024. This initiative encourages collective action by communities, civil society, and local governments to implement low-cost, locally appropriate water conservation solutions under a whole-of-society and whole-of-government approach. More than 1.48 lakhs works are completed under the JSJB initiative in the Khandwa district. To ensure effective implementation of the campaign, State Nodal Officers (SNOs) and District Nodal Officers (DNOs) have been appointed at the State and District levels, respectively, to monitor progress and to provide technical assistance. Besides, meetings are conducted with SNOs, Municipal Commissioners, District Magistrates (DMs)/ Deputy Commissioners (DCs), Partner Central Ministries/Departments, Central Nodal Officers (CNOs) and other stakeholders concerned to provide necessary support and gather feedback. Apart from the above, the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), in consultation with State Governments, assesses the country’s dynamic groundwater resources annually. These periodic estimations offer crucial insights into groundwater replenishment, utilization and overall availability across all assessment units, aiding various stakeholders in informed decision-making. Furthermore, Jal Shakti Kendras (JSKs) have been established, serving as dedicated resource and knowledge centers to provide technical guidance to locals and support district administration in implementation of rain water harvesting systems. In addition, District Water Conservation Plans have been formulated to ensure sustainable water management. The progress is also monitored through online portals such as JSA: CTR (https://jsactr.mowr.gov.in/) and JSJB ( https://jsactr.mowr.gov.in/JSJB/ ). Also, Government of India has been implementing a scheme namely Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) across the country which inter-alia includes water conservation and water harvesting structures. Financial assistance is given to various States under 15th Finance Commission tied grants which can be inter-alia utilized for rainwater harvesting. Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) has provisions for harvesting the rainwater through storm water drains into water body (which is not receiving sewage/effluent). Through preparation of ‘Aquifer Management Plan’ cities targets to strategize groundwater recharge augmentation by developing a roadmap for improving rain water harvesting within city limits. Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs formulated guidelines for the States to adopt measures suitable to local conditions, such as Unified Building Bye Laws (UBBL) of Delhi, 2016, Model Building Bye Laws (MBBL), 2016 and Urban and Regional Development Plan Formulation and Implementation (URDPFI) Guidelines, 2014 with adequate focus on requirement of rainwater harvesting and water conservation measures. Government of India is implementing “Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY)” with an aim to enhance physical access of water on farm and expand cultivable area under assured irrigation, improve on farm water use efficiency, introduce sustainable water conservation practices etc. PMKSY has three components/ schemes namely Har Khet Ko Pani (HKKP), Repair, Renovation & Restoration (RRR) Scheme of Water Bodies and Surface Minor irrigation (SMI) Scheme. National Water Policy (2012) has been formulated by Department of Water Resources, RD & GR, which inter-alia advocates rainwater harvesting and conservation of water and also highlights the need for augmenting the availability of water through direct use of rainfall. Department of Land Resources (DoLR) implements Watershed Development Component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (WDC-PMKSY) for the development of rainfed and degraded lands in the country. The activities undertaken, inter-alia, include ridge area treatment, drainage line treatment, soil and moisture conservation, rainwater harvesting, nursery raising, pasture development, livelihoods for asset-less persons etc. WDC-PMKSY, through these interventions, seeks to ensure sustainable development through improved natural resource management and better resilience of farmers to climate change Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) implements a Central Sector Scheme “Ground Water Management and Regulation (GWMR)” for providing scientific information for ground water management. The scheme is implemented throughout the country including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and the UT of Dadra & Nagar Haveli. Major activities taken up under the scheme includes aquifer mapping and other routine activities of CGWB such as ground water level and quality monitoring, assessment of dynamic ground water resources, strengthening of scientific infrastructure for technological upgradation, various outreach activities to promote water conservation and sustainable use etc. Central Ground Water Board has completed the National Aquifer Mapping Project in the entire mappable area of about 25 Lakh sq. km in the Country including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and UT of Dadra and Nagar Haveli. As per the Dynamic Ground Water Resources Assessments (DGWRA), the Stage of Ground Water Extraction in the district of Khandwa has improved from 41.48% in 2023 to 39.78% in 2025. The district-wise details of DGWRA 2025 for Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and UT of Dadar and Nagar Haveli, are given in Annexure IV, V and VI respectively.

                        18 DEC 2025 5:49PM by PIB Delhi Water being a State subject, the aspects related to water resources including its conservation are studied, planned, funded and executed by the State Governments themselves as per their own resources and priorities. The Central Government supplements the measures and efforts being taken up by the State Governments. The Government of India takes various initiatives on water conservation to ensure the long-term sustainability of water conservation. Major steps taken by the Government for water conservation and rainwater harvesting across the country including the states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and UT of Dadra and Nagar Haveli: The Ministry of Jal Shakti has been implementing Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) since 2019 across the country including the states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and UT of Dadra and Nagar Haveli. JSA: CTR has become a regular feature since 2021, with its sixth edition is implemented in all the districts (rural as well as urban) of the country from 22.03.2025 to 30.11.2025 under the theme “Jal Sanchay, Jan Bhagidari: Jan Jagrukta Ki Or”, emphasizing community participation and water conservation awareness. The campaign emphasizes convergent financing from various schemes of the Central, State and local bodies like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), Per Drop More Crop, Repair, Renovation and Restoration Components under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY), Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA), Finance Commission grants etc. Under the Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain (JSA: CTR) campaign, Khandwa district has completed more than 7,000 water conservation and water-related works during the last three years. The district has also established a Jal Shakti Kendra and prepared a District Water Conservation Plan. Further, the district wise details of the water conservation initiatives undertaken under the Jal Shakti Abhiyan in the states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and UT of Dadra and Nagar Haveli during the last three years are given at Annexures I, II and III respectively. To further deepen public involvement, ""Jal Sanchay Jan Bhagidari"" (JSJB) initiative was launched in Surat, Gujarat on 6th September 2024. This initiative encourages collective action by communities, civil society, and local governments to implement low-cost, locally appropriate water conservation solutions under a whole-of-society and whole-of-government approach. More than 1.48 lakhs works are completed under the JSJB initiative in the Khandwa district. To ensure effective implementation of the campaign, State Nodal Officers (SNOs) and District Nodal Officers (DNOs) have been appointed at the State and District levels, respectively, to monitor progress and to provide technical assistance. Besides, meetings are conducted with SNOs, Municipal Commissioners, District Magistrates (DMs)/ Deputy Commissioners (DCs), Partner Central Ministries/Departments, Central Nodal Officers (CNOs) and other stakeholders concerned to provide necessary support and gather feedback. Apart from the above, the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), in consultation with State Governments, assesses the country’s dynamic groundwater resources annually. These periodic estimations offer crucial insights into groundwater replenishment, utilization and overall availability across all assessment units, aiding various stakeholders in informed decision-making. Furthermore, Jal Shakti Kendras (JSKs) have been established, serving as dedicated resource and knowledge centers to provide technical guidance to locals and support district administration in implementation of rain water harvesting systems. In addition, District Water Conservation Plans have been formulated to ensure sustainable water management. The progress is also monitored through online portals such as JSA: CTR (https://jsactr.mowr.gov.in/) and JSJB ( https://jsactr.mowr.gov.in/JSJB/ ). Also, Government of India has been implementing a scheme namely Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) across the country which inter-alia includes water conservation and water harvesting structures. Financial assistance is given to various States under 15th Finance Commission tied grants which can be inter-alia utilized for rainwater harvesting. Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) has provisions for harvesting the rainwater through storm water drains into water body (which is not receiving sewage/effluent). Through preparation of ‘Aquifer Management Plan’ cities targets to strategize groundwater recharge augmentation by developing a roadmap for improving rain water harvesting within city limits. Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs formulated guidelines for the States to adopt measures suitable to local conditions, such as Unified Building Bye Laws (UBBL) of Delhi, 2016, Model Building Bye Laws (MBBL), 2016 and Urban and Regional Development Plan Formulation and Implementation (URDPFI) Guidelines, 2014 with adequate focus on requirement of rainwater harvesting and water conservation measures. Government of India is implementing “Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY)” with an aim to enhance physical access of water on farm and expand cultivable area under assured irrigation, improve on farm water use efficiency, introduce sustainable water conservation practices etc. PMKSY has three components/ schemes namely Har Khet Ko Pani (HKKP), Repair, Renovation & Restoration (RRR) Scheme of Water Bodies and Surface Minor irrigation (SMI) Scheme. National Water Policy (2012) has been formulated by Department of Water Resources, RD & GR, which inter-alia advocates rainwater harvesting and conservation of water and also highlights the need for augmenting the availability of water through direct use of rainfall. Department of Land Resources (DoLR) implements Watershed Development Component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (WDC-PMKSY) for the development of rainfed and degraded lands in the country. The activities undertaken, inter-alia, include ridge area treatment, drainage line treatment, soil and moisture conservation, rainwater harvesting, nursery raising, pasture development, livelihoods for asset-less persons etc. WDC-PMKSY, through these interventions, seeks to ensure sustainable development through improved natural resource management and better resilience of farmers to climate change Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) implements a Central Sector Scheme “Ground Water Management and Regulation (GWMR)” for providing scientific information for ground water management. The scheme is implemented throughout the country including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and the UT of Dadra & Nagar Haveli. Major activities taken up under the scheme includes aquifer mapping and other routine activities of CGWB such as ground water level and quality monitoring, assessment of dynamic ground water resources, strengthening of scientific infrastructure for technological upgradation, various outreach activities to promote water conservation and sustainable use etc. Central Ground Water Board has completed the National Aquifer Mapping Project in the entire mappable area of about 25 Lakh sq. km in the Country including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and UT of Dadra and Nagar Haveli. As per the Dynamic Ground Water Resources Assessments (DGWRA), the Stage of Ground Water Extraction in the district of Khandwa has improved from 41.48% in 2023 to 39.78% in 2025. The district-wise details of DGWRA 2025 for Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and UT of Dadar and Nagar Haveli, are given in Annexure IV, V and VI respectively. The information was provided by THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI SHRI RAJ BHUSHAN CHOUDHARY in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today. *** ND ANNEXURE-I Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain National Water Mission, Ministry of Jal Shakti MAHARASHTRA -

                18 DEC 2025 5:45PM by PIB Delhi Dynamic Ground Water Resources of the country are being annually assessed, jointly by Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) and State Governments. As per the 2025 assessment, the total Annual Ground Water Recharge in the country is 448.52 Billion Cubic Meter (BCM) and the Annual Extractable Ground Water Resources is estimated as 407.75 BCM. The Further, total Annual Ground Water Extraction of the entire country for the year 2025 has been assessed as 247.22 BCM. Based on this, the Stage of Ground Water Extraction (SoE), which is a measure of Annual Ground Water Extraction for all uses (irrigation, industrial and domestic uses) over Annual Extractable Ground Water Resource is worked out to be 60.63% for the country as a whole . Regarding categorization of units in terms of their stage of ground water extraction, out of the total 6762 Assessment Units (Blocks/Taluks/Mandals) in the country, 730 (10.80%) units have been categorized as ‘Over- exploited’ indicating ground water extraction exceeding the annually replenishable ground water recharge. Further, 201 units (2.97 %) have been categorized as ‘Critical’, 758 units (11.21 %) as ‘Semi-critical’ and 4946 units (73.14 %) are in ‘Safe’ category. Additionally, 127 assessment units (1.88%) are categorized as ‘saline’. State/UT-wise details are provided in Annexure -I. Further, the District-Wise Ground Water Resources for all the states, including Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Odisha can be seen in the National Compilation of Dynamic Ground Water Resources of India, 2025 which can be accessed at: https://cgwb.gov.in/cgwbpnm/download/1741#page=171 Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) generates ground water quality data of the country on a regional scale as part of its ground water quality monitoring program and various scientific studies conducted as per the approved Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). Overall, the data on ground water quality indicates that the ground water in the country remains largely potable with localized occurrences of contaminants in isolated pockets. State-wise distribution of major pollutants such as Arsenic, Fluoride, Nitrate and heavy metals, as per the Annual Ground Water Quality Report – 2025 can be viewed through the web link provided below: https://cgwb.gov.in/cgwbpnm/public/uploads/documents/1764833633531847433file.pdf Efforts of the Central government towards ground water monitoring, aquifer mapping and recharge along with spreading community awareness, are mainly channeled through the schemes/programmes like Ground Water Management & Regulation (GWM &R) Scheme, Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA), Jal Sanchay Jan Bhagidari (JSJB), Atal Bhujal Yojana etc. GWM &R is a central sector scheme under which funds are not disbursed to states but rather are completely allocated and spent by CGWB for the purpose of ground water monitoring, mapping and regulation. Further, JSA and JSJB take up large scale construction/rejuvenation of artificial recharge/rain water harvesting works through convergence with ongoing central and state schemes and no separate funds are allotted for this purpose. As per the available data on JSA dashboard, an expenditure of approximately Rs. 1.5 lakh cr has been incurred towards this since 2021 through convergence with MGNREGS alone. NAQUIM studies have been taken up across the country by the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) for delineation and characterisation of aquifers and preparation of plans for ground water management. NAQUIM was initiated as a part of the ‘Ground Water Management and Regulation’ scheme and the entire mappable area of the country of about 25 lakh sq. kms has been mapped. State wise details of coverage area under NAQUIM is presented in Annexure -II. Further, ground water management studies/ plans have been prepared for the entire targeted area across the country covering all the 14 Principal aquifers and 42 major aquifers and District-wise aquifer maps and management plans for 654 Districts of the country, which include both supply side and demand side measures for sustainable management of ground water resources, have been shared with the concerned State/District administrations for taking up suitable field interventions. Moreover, Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater- 2020 has been prepared by the CGWB and shared with States/UTs providing a broad outline for construction of around 1.42 crore rain water harvesting and artificial recharge structures in the country with estimated cost, which has a potential to harness around 185 BCM (Billion cubic meter) of water. The Ministry of Jal Shakti is currently conducting stakeholder consultations for assessing the ground water extraction Guidelines. ‘Water’ being a State subject, sustainable development and management of groundwater resources and address contamination issues is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments. The Central Government, on its part, facilitates the efforts of the State Governments by way of technical and financial assistance through its various schemes and projects. The major steps taken by the government in this direction, for improving ground water conservation and recharge, regulating over-extraction, mitigation of contamination and saltwater intrusion and ensuring long term sustainability of the resource in the country, along with their impact, are provided below: Efforts of the Central government for augmenting the water/groundwater resources of the country, are mainly channeled through the flagship campaign of Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA). JSA is a time bound and mission mode programme being conducted annually since 2019 by the M/o Jal Shakti, wherein all the efforts and funds under various schemes and projects are converged to deliver water harvesting and artificial recharge works on the ground. Currently, JSA 2025 is underway in the country with special focus on over-exploited and critical districts. As per the available information, under JSA, completion of around 1.21 crore water conservation and artificial recharge works has been coordinated through convergence in the country in the last 4 years, which has played a key role in enhancing the sustainability of ground water resources. To further strengthen the momentum of Jal Shakti Abhiyan, Jal Sanchay Jan Bhagidari (JSJB): A Community-Driven Path to Water Sustainability in India has been launched by the Hon’ble Prime Minister with a vision to make rain water harvesting a mass movement in the country. By promoting community ownership and responsibility, the initiative seeks to develop cost-eﬀective, local solutions tailored to speciﬁc water challenges across diﬀerent regions. M/o Jal Shakti has constituted the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) for the purpose of regulation and control of ground water extraction in the Country and has notified Guidelines dated 24.09.2020 for the purpose of such regulation, which have pan India applicability. Additionally, stringent measures like imposition of heavy penalties & Environmental Compensation Charges (EC) extraction without valid NOC, prohibiting new large-scale industries in over-exploited areas, sealing of bore wells for illegal extraction etc. have been mandated by the Guidelines to regulate over extraction. M/o Jal Shakti has successfully demonstrated the efficacy of community led participatory ground water management through Atal Bhujal Yojana, which was implemented in 80 water stressed districts in 7 States, viz. Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Construction/rejuvenation of more than 83,000 rain water harvesting and recharge structures like check dams, ponds, shafts etc. was completed under the scheme and more than 9 lakh Ha area was brought under efficient irrigation practices. Mission Amrit Sarovar was launched by the Government of India which aimed at developing and rejuvenating at least 75 water bodies in each district of the country. As an outcome nearly 69,000 Amrit Sarovars have been constructed/rejuvenated in the country, leading to enhanced water storage and ground water recharge. In addition to conducting extensive aquifer mapping activities throughout the country, CGWB has also prepared the Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater- 2020, which is a macro level plan indicating various structures for the different terrain conditions of the country for serving as a technical guide for construction of artificial recharge and rain water harvesting structures. Regarding ground water quality aspect, CGWB regularly monitors ground water quality samples throughout the country as per its SOP and issues Annual reports, Half-yearly Bulletins and fortnightly alerts regarding its findings for quick action by stakeholders; Technique for constructing Arsenic and Fluoride safe wells has also been developed by CGWB and guidance is provided to states for replication and upscaling; Further, the Government is also implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) in partnership with states for providing safe and adequate drinking water to all rural households of the country. Various organizations under this Ministry like National Institute of Hydrology (NIH), CGWB, Central Water Commission (CWC) etc. have conducted independent studies in various parts of the country affected by salinity ingress and saltwater intrusion and made several recommendations like construction of embankments, sea walls, inlet control mechanism at creeks etc. In order to assess the impact of various water conservation interventions on ground water level in the last five years, the post-monsoon 2024 State/UT-wise water level data for the country is compared with the Mean of the previous 5 years (post-monsoon water level data from 2019-23), which is provided in Annexure-III . Such analysis indicates that in the country as a whole, about 54.4 % of analyzed wells showed rising water levels in 2024 as compared to the mean level of previous 5 years. Further, similar analysis for Palghar district (Maharashtra), Nabarangpur district (Odisha) and Pali Lok Sabha Constituency in Rajasthan (covering Pali & Jodhpur Districts) is presented in Annexure -IV, which indicates that in Palghar District of Maharashtra 80% analyzed wells have shown rise in 2024 as compared with the mean of previous 5 years, in Nabarangpur district of Odisha, 25% of wells and have shown rise and in Jodhpur & Pali districts under Pali Lok Sabha Constituency, respectively 68.9% & 81.25% of wells have shown rising trends .

                        18 DEC 2025 5:45PM by PIB Delhi Dynamic Ground Water Resources of the country are being annually assessed, jointly by Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) and State Governments. As per the 2025 assessment, the total Annual Ground Water Recharge in the country is 448.52 Billion Cubic Meter (BCM) and the Annual Extractable Ground Water Resources is estimated as 407.75 BCM. The Further, total Annual Ground Water Extraction of the entire country for the year 2025 has been assessed as 247.22 BCM. Based on this, the Stage of Ground Water Extraction (SoE), which is a measure of Annual Ground Water Extraction for all uses (irrigation, industrial and domestic uses) over Annual Extractable Ground Water Resource is worked out to be 60.63% for the country as a whole . Regarding categorization of units in terms of their stage of ground water extraction, out of the total 6762 Assessment Units (Blocks/Taluks/Mandals) in the country, 730 (10.80%) units have been categorized as ‘Over- exploited’ indicating ground water extraction exceeding the annually replenishable ground water recharge. Further, 201 units (2.97 %) have been categorized as ‘Critical’, 758 units (11.21 %) as ‘Semi-critical’ and 4946 units (73.14 %) are in ‘Safe’ category. Additionally, 127 assessment units (1.88%) are categorized as ‘saline’. State/UT-wise details are provided in Annexure -I. Further, the District-Wise Ground Water Resources for all the states, including Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Odisha can be seen in the National Compilation of Dynamic Ground Water Resources of India, 2025 which can be accessed at: https://cgwb.gov.in/cgwbpnm/download/1741#page=171 Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) generates ground water quality data of the country on a regional scale as part of its ground water quality monitoring program and various scientific studies conducted as per the approved Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). Overall, the data on ground water quality indicates that the ground water in the country remains largely potable with localized occurrences of contaminants in isolated pockets. State-wise distribution of major pollutants such as Arsenic, Fluoride, Nitrate and heavy metals, as per the Annual Ground Water Quality Report – 2025 can be viewed through the web link provided below: https://cgwb.gov.in/cgwbpnm/public/uploads/documents/1764833633531847433file.pdf Efforts of the Central government towards ground water monitoring, aquifer mapping and recharge along with spreading community awareness, are mainly channeled through the schemes/programmes like Ground Water Management & Regulation (GWM &R) Scheme, Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA), Jal Sanchay Jan Bhagidari (JSJB), Atal Bhujal Yojana etc. GWM &R is a central sector scheme under which funds are not disbursed to states but rather are completely allocated and spent by CGWB for the purpose of ground water monitoring, mapping and regulation. Further, JSA and JSJB take up large scale construction/rejuvenation of artificial recharge/rain water harvesting works through convergence with ongoing central and state schemes and no separate funds are allotted for this purpose. As per the available data on JSA dashboard, an expenditure of approximately Rs. 1.5 lakh cr has been incurred towards this since 2021 through convergence with MGNREGS alone. NAQUIM studies have been taken up across the country by the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) for delineation and characterisation of aquifers and preparation of plans for ground water management. NAQUIM was initiated as a part of the ‘Ground Water Management and Regulation’ scheme and the entire mappable area of the country of about 25 lakh sq. kms has been mapped. State wise details of coverage area under NAQUIM is presented in Annexure -II. Further, ground water management studies/ plans have been prepared for the entire targeted area across the country covering all the 14 Principal aquifers and 42 major aquifers and District-wise aquifer maps and management plans for 654 Districts of the country, which include both supply side and demand side measures for sustainable management of ground water resources, have been shared with the concerned State/District administrations for taking up suitable field interventions. Moreover, Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater- 2020 has been prepared by the CGWB and shared with States/UTs providing a broad outline for construction of around 1.42 crore rain water harvesting and artificial recharge structures in the country with estimated cost, which has a potential to harness around 185 BCM (Billion cubic meter) of water. The Ministry of Jal Shakti is currently conducting stakeholder consultations for assessing the ground water extraction Guidelines. ‘Water’ being a State subject, sustainable development and management of groundwater resources and address contamination issues is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments. The Central Government, on its part, facilitates the efforts of the State Governments by way of technical and financial assistance through its various schemes and projects. The major steps taken by the government in this direction, for improving ground water conservation and recharge, regulating over-extraction, mitigation of contamination and saltwater intrusion and ensuring long term sustainability of the resource in the country, along with their impact, are provided below: Efforts of the Central government for augmenting the water/groundwater resources of the country, are mainly channeled through the flagship campaign of Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA). JSA is a time bound and mission mode programme being conducted annually since 2019 by the M/o Jal Shakti, wherein all the efforts and funds under various schemes and projects are converged to deliver water harvesting and artificial recharge works on the ground. Currently, JSA 2025 is underway in the country with special focus on over-exploited and critical districts. As per the available information, under JSA, completion of around 1.21 crore water conservation and artificial recharge works has been coordinated through convergence in the country in the last 4 years, which has played a key role in enhancing the sustainability of ground water resources. To further strengthen the momentum of Jal Shakti Abhiyan, Jal Sanchay Jan Bhagidari (JSJB): A Community-Driven Path to Water Sustainability in India has been launched by the Hon’ble Prime Minister with a vision to make rain water harvesting a mass movement in the country. By promoting community ownership and responsibility, the initiative seeks to develop cost-eﬀective, local solutions tailored to speciﬁc water challenges across diﬀerent regions. M/o Jal Shakti has constituted the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) for the purpose of regulation and control of ground water extraction in the Country and has notified Guidelines dated 24.09.2020 for the purpose of such regulation, which have pan India applicability. Additionally, stringent measures like imposition of heavy penalties & Environmental Compensation Charges (EC) extraction without valid NOC, prohibiting new large-scale industries in over-exploited areas, sealing of bore wells for illegal extraction etc. have been mandated by the Guidelines to regulate over extraction. M/o Jal Shakti has successfully demonstrated the efficacy of community led participatory ground water management through Atal Bhujal Yojana, which was implemented in 80 water stressed districts in 7 States, viz. Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Construction/rejuvenation of more than 83,000 rain water harvesting and recharge structures like check dams, ponds, shafts etc. was completed under the scheme and more than 9 lakh Ha area was brought under efficient irrigation practices. Mission Amrit Sarovar was launched by the Government of India which aimed at developing and rejuvenating at least 75 water bodies in each district of the country. As an outcome nearly 69,000 Amrit Sarovars have been constructed/rejuvenated in the country, leading to enhanced water storage and ground water recharge. In addition to conducting extensive aquifer mapping activities throughout the country, CGWB has also prepared the Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater- 2020, which is a macro level plan indicating various structures for the different terrain conditions of the country for serving as a technical guide for construction of artificial recharge and rain water harvesting structures. Regarding ground water quality aspect, CGWB regularly monitors ground water quality samples throughout the country as per its SOP and issues Annual reports, Half-yearly Bulletins and fortnightly alerts regarding its findings for quick action by stakeholders; Technique for constructing Arsenic and Fluoride safe wells has also been developed by CGWB and guidance is provided to states for replication and upscaling; Further, the Government is also implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) in partnership with states for providing safe and adequate drinking water to all rural households of the country. Various organizations under this Ministry like National Institute of Hydrology (NIH), CGWB, Central Water Commission (CWC) etc. have conducted independent studies in various parts of the country affected by salinity ingress and saltwater intrusion and made several recommendations like construction of embankments, sea walls, inlet control mechanism at creeks etc. In order to assess the impact of various water conservation interventions on ground water level in the last five years, the post-monsoon 2024 State/UT-wise water level data for the country is compared with the Mean of the previous 5 years (post-monsoon water level data from 2019-23), which is provided in Annexure-III . Such analysis indicates that in the country as a whole, about 54.4 % of analyzed wells showed rising water levels in 2024 as compared to the mean level of previous 5 years. Further, similar analysis for Palghar district (Maharashtra), Nabarangpur district (Odisha) and Pali Lok Sabha Constituency in Rajasthan (covering Pali & Jodhpur Districts) is presented in Annexure -IV, which indicates that in Palghar District of Maharashtra 80% analyzed wells have shown rise in 2024 as compared with the mean of previous 5 years, in Nabarangpur district of Odisha, 25% of wells and have shown rise and in Jodhpur & Pali districts under Pali Lok Sabha Constituency, respectively 68.9% & 81.25% of wells have shown rising trends .

                18 DEC 2025 5:11PM by PIB Delhi The National Project for Strengthening Community-Based Disaster Risk Reduction Initiatives in Panchayati Raj Institutions, jointly implemented by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) and the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), has been approved with an outlay of ₹507.37 crores. The project will be implemented across 20 States and will cover 81 disaster-prone districts with 20 Gram Panchayats each, while additionally also developing 20 Gram Panchayats focused on major hazard-specific risks as replicable models for local-level Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). The initiative seeks to integrate disaster risk reduction into local governance through a bottom-up approach, positioning Panchayati Raj Institutions as the backbone of disaster preparedness, mitigation and resilience at the grassroots level. These Model Gram Panchayats will serve as demonstrative templates for integrating disaster resilience into planning, infrastructure and community preparedness. ( For more information ) The project encompasses institutional strengthening and policy integration of DRR in development planning by PRIs, extensive capacity building and awareness generation for State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs), District Disaster Management Authorities (DDMAs), and elected representatives and functionaries of Panchayats, supported by targeted Information, Education and Communication (IEC) initiatives. It also focuses on fostering inter-institutional coordination among local, district, and state-level stakeholders to enable effective and sustained disaster mitigation. The Ministry of Panchayati Raj will leverage its digital platforms, including eGramSwaraj, Gram Manchitra etc., to integrate disaster management planning, track expenditures, and disseminate real-time information to Panchayats. Extensive capacity-building programmes will be undertaken for elected representatives of Panchayats, Panchayat functionaries, master trainers, and community volunteers, ensuring sustained institutional capability at the grassroots. Together, MoPR and NDMA, in close coordination with States and Panchayats, are laying the foundation for a resilient rural India, where empowered local institutions and informed communities play a central role in safeguarding lives, livelihoods, and infrastructure against disasters. 1 Model Village in each State (*Model Village to be decided by the States): S/N States Amount in Crore Hazard 1 Himachal Pradesh 5 Flash Flood / Landslide 2 Uttarakhand 5 Flash Flood / Landslide 3 Kerala 5 Ecosystem-Based Mitigation/Coastal Erosion 4 Odisha 5 Cyclone / Drought 5 Arunachal Pradesh 5 Flash Flood / Landslide 6 Sikkim 5 Ecosystem-Based Mitigation/ landslide 7 Assam 5 Flood / Ecosystem based Mitigation 8 Meghalaya 5 Landslide / Flood 9 Maharashtra 5 Drought / Earthquake 10 Rajasthan 5 Drought / Flood 11 Uttar Pradesh 5 Earthquake/ Flood 12 Tamil Nadu 5 Cyclone / Drought 13 Andhra Pradesh 5 Cyclone / landslide 14 Punjab 5 Earthquake / River Erosion 15 Bihar 5 Earthquake / Flood 16 Nagaland 5 Ecosystem-Based Mitigation/ landslide 17 Karnataka 5 Drought/Landslide 18 Mizoram 5 Flash Flood / Landslide 19 Tripura 5 Flood / Earthquake 20 Gujarat 5 Earthquake/Flood Total 100 An innovative concept of Model Gram Panchayat has been incorporated in this program.

Therefore, 20 Model Gram Panchayats will be identified by States exclusively for six different hazards (one GP for each hazard) themes for implementation of a long-term mitigation strategy for an end-to-end model to showcase the effectiveness of long-lasting mitigation measures on disaster proofing. The learnings in the identified 20 Gram Panchayats can be scaled up by the States through their SDMF for replicating as a disaster-resilient Gram Panchayat model for other Gram Panchayats. Depending on the size of the State and intensity of the disasters, the number of Districts has been taken.

                18 DEC 2025 5:51PM by PIB Delhi The Capacity Building Commission (CBC), in collaboration with the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE), Ministry of Finance, organised the Bharat CPSEs’ Consultative Conclave, today at New Delhi. The conclave, themed “Shaping India’s Growth Story through DAKSH PSEs @2047”, brought together senior leadership from Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs), Central Ministries, and key institutional stakeholders. The conclave was convened with the objective of developing a shared and structured CPSEs’ Capacity Building Roadmap, aligned with Mission Karmayogi—India’s National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building. It sought to integrate principles of good governance into CPSEs’ human capital strategies, strengthen leadership and succession planning, and promote inter-CPSE collaboration to support the national vision of Viksit Bharat @2047. The programme was steered by Dr. Alka Mittal, Member (Administration), Capacity Building Commission. While setting the context of the Conclave, Dr Mittal underscored the strategic role of CPSEs as critical institutions for nation-building beyond their commercial mandate. She highlighted that CPSEs are not only engines of economic growth, but also custodians of public values, governance standards, and long-term institutional capability. Ms. S. Radha Chauhan, Chairperson, Capacity Building Commission, highlighted the importance of embedding competency-based governance, leadership development, and performance-linked learning within CPSEs as part of India’s broader civil services reform agenda. She emphasised upon de-siloization of governance and democratization of learning. The ethos of Karmayogi should imbibe in every delivery of public service, she said. The inaugural address was delivered by Shri K Moses Chalai, Secretary, Department of Public Enterprises, who highlighted the fact that leadership is very important and we need visionary leaders. He later added that we should be open to change and adopt good changes. Members of the Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) Shri Alkesh Kumar Sharma and Shri Roop Narayan Sunkar also shared their key observations. A strategic keynote session was delivered by Dr. C. Jayakumar, Executive Vice President & Head, Corporate Human Resources, Larsen & Toubro (L&T) Ltd on “HR Strategies for Purpose-Driven Leadership”, focusing on building resilient leadership pipelines and aligning organisational values with national priorities. This was followed by a presentation on DAKSH (Development of Aspiration, Knowledge, Succession and Harmony) by Shri Atul Sobti, Director General, SCOPE, outlining a structured framework for leadership development, succession planning, and HR reforms in CPSEs. Secretary, MNRE, Shri Santosh Kumar Sarangi, Dr R Balasubramaniam, Member (HR), CBC, CEO Karmayogi Bharat (KB) Ms Chhavi Bhardwaj, senior officials from DPE, Ministries and CBC were also present during the inaugural session. The conclave featured focused roundtable discussions on “Reimagining HR Systems for High-Impact CPSE Performance” and “Translating Vision into Action: CPSE HR Strategy”. These discussions enabled peer learning among CPSEs on leadership development, learning and development systems, succession planning, and alignment of HR policies with governance and performance outcomes. Participants emphasised the need for institutionalised collaboration, shared knowledge platforms, and integrated capacity-building efforts to enhance efficiency, innovation, and public value creation beyond financial returns. The discussions reinforced the importance of aligning CPSE human capital strategies with national development priorities and governance reforms under Mission Karmayogi. The conclave is expected to culminate in the development of a “CPSE Capacity Building Compendium”, which will capture best practices, capability gaps, and collaborative models for inter-CPSE capacity development over the next 6–12 months. The CBC will also bring the Training Institutes, PSUs and States on a common platform for collaboration aligned with Karmayogi capacity building efforts across governance space. As a follow up of this conclave, CBC is planning the following Thematic Events for Capacity Building of CPSEs: Financial Management: Long-term capital planning, risk frameworks, governance excellence (including FSIB Sector). R&D, Technology & Innovation Ecosystems: Tech adoption pathways, innovation partnerships, digital transformation (with Academia, ANRF, Research Councils). CSR, ESG & Sustainability Leadership: Responsible business, ESG metrics, climate-aligned strategies Engineering, Projects & Asset Management Excellence: Best-in-class Project Management models, Mega-project execution, Operational Resilience. Learning, Development & Training Ecosystem: Strengthening Capabilities, Cross-PSE knowledge exchange, Research-driven training models. The programme concluded with closing reflections by Shri S. P. Roy, Secretary, Capacity Building Commission who said that CBC is always committed to support capacity building initiatives of CPSEs.  The vote of thanks was delivered by Ms Navneet Kaur, Director, Capacity Building Commission. The Bharat CPSE Consultative Conclave marks a significant step towards strengthening leadership, governance, and institutional capacity of CPSEs in alignment with India’s long-term development vision. ****** NKR/AK (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2206088) आगंतुक पटल  : 94 इस विज्ञप्ति को इन भाषाओं में पढ़ें: Urdu , हिन्दी Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions CBC organises “Bharat CPSEs’ Consultative Conclave” on “Shaping India’s Growth Story through DAKSH PSEs @2047” Chairperson CBC emphasizes upon de-siloization of governance and democratization of learning Dr Alka Mittal, Member, CBC underscores strategic role of CPSEs as critical institutions for nation-building We should be open to change and adapt good changes, says Secretary, DPE, Shri K Moses Chalai प्रविष्टि तिथि:

                18 DEC 2025 4:37PM by PIB Delhi As on 31.10.2025, the country’s total installed generation capacity has reached 5,05,023 MW, comprising of 2,45,600 MW of fossil-fuel sources and 2,59,423 MW of non-fossil fuel sources (including 2,50,643 MW from renewable energy sources). The details of country's current composition of installed generation capacity, indicating the share of renewable and non-fossil fuel sources are given below . The Government of India has taken several steps and initiatives to promote and accelerate renewable energy capacity in the country to realize the commitment of 500 GW non-fossil energy capacity by 2030. These include, inter-alia, the following: Inter State Transmission System (ISTS) charges have been waived for inter-state sale of solar and wind power for projects to be commissioned by 30th June 2025, for Green Hydrogen Projects till December 2030 and for offshore wind projects till December 2032. Standard Bidding Guidelines for tariff based competitive bidding process for procurement of Power from Grid Connected Solar, Wind, Wind-Solar Hybrid and Firm & Dispatchable RE (FDRE) projects have been issued. Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) has issued Bidding Trajectory for issuance of RE power procurement bids of 50 GW/annum by Renewable Energy Implementing Agencies (REIAs) from FY 2023-24 to FY 2027-28. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has been permitted up to 100 percent under the automatic route. Laying of new transmission lines and creating new sub-station capacity has been funded under the Green Energy Corridor Scheme for evacuation of renewable power To augment transmission infrastructure needed for steep RE trajectory, transmission plan has been prepared till 2032. Scheme for setting up of Solar Parks and Ultra Mega Solar Power projects is being implemented to provide land and transmission to RE developers for installation of RE projects at large scale Schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM), PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, National Programme on High Efficiency Solar PV Modules, New Solar Power Scheme (for Tribal and PVTG Habitations/Villages) under Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM JANMAN) and Dharti Aabha Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (DA JGUA), National Green Hydrogen Mission, Viability Gap Funding (VGF) Scheme for Offshore Wind Energy Projects have been launched To boost RE consumption, Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) followed by Renewable Consumption Obligation (RCO) trajectory has been notified till 2029-30. The RCO which is applicable to all designated consumers under the Energy Conservation Act 2001 will attract penalties on non-compliance. RCO also includes specified quantum of consumption from Decentralized Renewable Energy sources. “Strategy for Establishments of Offshore Wind Energy Projects” has been issued. To achieve the objective of increased domestic production of Solar PV Modules, the Govt. of India is implementing the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for High Efficiency Solar PV Modules. India has achieved a landmark in its energy transition journey by reaching 50% of its installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources in June, 2025 – more than five years ahead of the target set under its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreement. This significant milestone underscores the country’s steadfast commitment to climate action and sustainable development. The impact of this achievement on India’s long term energy transition roadmap is crucial towards the goal of combating climate change, keeping in view energy security, affordability and accessibility as critical inalienable priorities to ensure growth and development alongside Energy transition of the economy towards net-zero by 2070. The major steps taken by India to diversify its Energy Portfolio through clean and safe sources are detailed below: Nuclear power has huge potential to ensure long term energy security and is vital for India’s clean energy transition towards Net Zero by 2070. It is a clean and environment friendly source of base load power. The lifecycle emissions of nuclear power are comparable to those of renewables like hydro and wind.  The Government of India has set an ambitious target of 100 GW nuclear power capacity by 2047. Following steps have been taken   to diversify India’s energy portfolio through Nuclear Energy: A dedicated Nuclear Energy Mission with an allocation of ₹20,000 crore has been launched to develop at least five indigenously designed Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) by 2033 and promote advanced nuclear technologies. Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill, 2025 has been introduced in Parliament to pave a way to harness the full potential of India’s nuclear energy based on indigenous resources to the maximum extent through active involvement of both the public and private sectors. Bharat Small Reactors (BSRs) of 220 MW capacity based on India’s proven Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) technology are being upgraded for deployment in industrial hubs to support decarbonisation. BARC is also developing Small Modular Reactors for repurposing retiring coal stations and for remote-area applications. India’s fuel security is being enhanced through new uranium discoveries, including a significant discovery that would extend the life of the Jaduguda mine by over 50 years. Progress in the closed fuel cycle, such as milestones achieved in the Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor, will further support sustainable fuel supply. To accelerate capacity addition, NPCIL and NTPC have formed the joint venture ASHVINI for developing nuclear power plants within the existing legal framework. Government of India, in September 2023, approved a Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme for development of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS). BESS capacity of 13.22 GWh is under implementation with a budgetary allocation of Rs. 3,760 Cr. under this scheme. Considering the increasing demand of BESS, Ministry of Power, in June 2025, has approved another VGF scheme for development of 30 GWh BESS capacity with a financial support of Rs 5,400 Cr from Power System Development Fund (PSDF). Ministry of Power has introduced a policy to promote Pumped Storage Projects (PSPs) to support renewable energy integration and grid stability. At present, 10 Pumped Storage Projects totaling 11,870 MW are under construction in the country. Strategy for Establishments of Offshore Wind Energy Projects has been issued. Viability gap funding will be provided for harnessing offshore wind energy potential for initial capacity of one giga-watt. Green Hydrogen Mission would contribute significantly to India’s efforts for decarbonization and also create opportunities for employment and economic development. The Mission targets setting up at least 5 MMT per annum of green hydrogen capacity by 2030.

Government of India, in September 2023, approved a Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme for development of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS). BESS capacity of 13.22 GWh is under implementation with a budgetary allocation of Rs. 3,760 Cr. under this scheme. Considering the increasing demand of BESS, Ministry of Power, in June 2025, has approved another VGF scheme for development of 30 GWh BESS capacity with a financial support of Rs 5,400 Cr from Power System Development Fund (PSDF). Ministry of Power has introduced a policy to promote Pumped Storage Projects (PSPs) to support renewable energy integration and grid stability. At present, 10 Pumped Storage Projects totaling 11,870 MW are under construction in the country. Strategy for Establishments of Offshore Wind Energy Projects has been issued. Viability gap funding will be provided for harnessing offshore wind energy potential for initial capacity of one giga-watt. Green Hydrogen Mission would contribute significantly to India’s efforts for decarbonization and also create opportunities for employment and economic development. The Mission targets setting up at least 5 MMT per annum of green hydrogen capacity by 2030.

                18 DEC 2025 4:36PM by PIB Delhi To address the intermittency of renewable energy and to maintain grid stability, the Government of India has taken a series of coordinated policy, regulatory, demand-side and supply-side measures to promote the development and deployment of energy-storage technologies, including Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and Pumped Storage Projects (PSPs).  Details of the measures taken are detailed below. The Government is drawing upon global best practices from countries with high renewable-energy penetration as part of India’s energy-transition strategy.  International experience demonstrates that Pumped-hydro storage and BESS, and advanced grid-management systems play a critical role in managing variability and intermittency of renewable energy.  In line with these practices, energy storage systems in India are being positioned to provide ancillary grid services such as frequency control, voltage regulation, peak shifting, congestion management and black-start support across different time scales. Accordingly, under the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (Ancillary Services) Regulations, 2022, energy storage systems have been made eligible to provide Secondary Reserve Ancillary Services and Tertiary Reserve Ancillary Services, subject to specified conditions, thereby supporting real-time grid stability and reliable system operation. Renewable Energy Management Centres (REMCs) have been established for monitoring, forecasting and scheduling of Renewable resources.  ⁠ Automatic Generation Control (AGC)is being used for balancing supply and demand to manage variability of renewable energy. Government has put in place a planning framework to guide large-scale deployment of energy storage capacity in the coming years.  The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has estimated a requirement of about 336 GWh of energy storage capacity by 2029-30 and about 411 GWh by 2031-32 to facilitate reliable integration of renewable energy.  Further, Guidelines for Preparation of Resource Adequacy Plans (RAP) were issued on 28.06.2023, which incorporate energy storage systems as an important element of power sector planning.  These guidelines establish a mechanism to ensure that adequate generation, storage and demand-responsive resources are available to reliably meet expected peak demand and maintain grid stability.  Together, the National Electricity Plan and Resource Adequacy framework provide a roadmap for scaling up energy-storage capacity, improving system reliability and enabling India’s energy transition. Policy and Regulatory Measures The Electricity Rules were amended in December 2022 to explicitly recognise Energy Storage Systems (ESS) as an integral part of the power system, enabling their participation across generation, transmission and distribution functions. In October 2022, ESS were included in the Harmonised Master List of Infrastructure of the Ministry of Finance, facilitating access to long-tenure and lower-cost financing. In June 2023, the Government issued Guidelines for Preparation of Resource Adequacy Plans by State utilities, under which energy storage has been incorporated as a key planning resource for meeting peak demand and ensuring system reliability. A National Framework for Promotion of Energy Storage Systems was issued in September 2023, providing a comprehensive roadmap for deployment, market integration and regulatory facilitation of storage technologies. To enhance safety and reliability of BESS installations and standardise design and construction practices, Draft CEA (Measures Relating to Safety and Electric Supply) (First Amendment) Regulations, 2025 and Draft Technical Standards for Construction of BESS Regulations, 2025 have been issued. II. Demand-Side Enablers and Market Development Measures Waiver of Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) charges has been provided for co-located BESS projects commissioned and PSPs awarded up to June 2028, to improve project viability (initial waiver was notified in November 2021). In January 2022, CERC allowed storage-based resources to provide ancillary services, including secondary and tertiary reserves, enabling ESS to support real-time grid balancing alongside conventional generators. Tariff-Based Competitive Bidding (TBCB) Guidelines for procurement of BESS by distribution licensees were notified in March 2022, creating a transparent mechanism for large-scale storage procurement. Under the Electricity (Rights of Consumers) Rules, 2020, amended in December 2022, consumers using diesel generator sets have been mandated to shift to cleaner backup solutions, including energy storage, within timelines specified by State Commissions. Electricity supplied from BESS has been allowed to participate in the High-Price Day-Ahead Market, launched in March 2023, enabling storage to respond to peak price signals similar to gas-based generation. The Government is implementing two Viability Gap Funding (VGF) schemes to support development of approximately 43 GWh of Battery Energy Storage Systems, launched in March 2024 and June 2025, to accelerate early-stage deployment. III. Supply-Side and Manufacturing-Focused Measures The Ministry of Heavy Industries is implementing a Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme with an outlay of ₹18,100 crore for establishing 50 GWh of Advanced Chemistry Cell manufacturing capacity, of which 10 GWh is earmarked for grid-scale storage (June 2021). For pumped storage projects, a grant for enabling infrastructure is provided at the rate of ₹1 crore per MW for the first 200 MW and ₹0.75 crore per MW thereafter (September 2023). CERC has allowed separate grid connectivity during non-solar hours, enabling additional renewable capacity at existing substations and facilitating storage-based shifting of power to evening and night hours (September 2025). Statutory concurrence of the Central Electricity Authority has been dispensed with for closed-loop, off-stream pumped storage projects to expedite project development (August 2025). Through amendment of the Electricity Rules in September 2025, energy storage systems have been permitted to be developed, owned, leased or operated by consumers, expanding the range of ownership and business models. In February 2025, CEA issued an advisory on co-location of ESS with solar power projects, recommending storage capacity of at least 10% of installed solar capacity for a minimum duration of two hours, to improve dispatchability of solar power. This Information was given by the Minister of State for Power, Shri Shripad Yesso Naik, in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today. ********* NR/MD (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205959) आगंतुक पटल  : 133 Ministry of Power Development and Deployment of Energy Storage Capacities to Power Reliable Renewable Future प्रविष्टि तिथि:

                18 DEC 2025 3:44PM by PIB Delhi Union Minister of State for Power and New & Renewable Energy, Shri Shripad Yesso Naik, while addressing a press conference in New delhi today said that India’s journey towards Atmanirbharta in defence has been decisively shaped by the visionary and resolute leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, whose clear articulation that national security, economic strength and technological sovereignty are deeply interconnected has transformed defence manufacturing from a strategic necessity into a national mission. The Minister said that the country has moved with confidence from being a major importer of defence equipment to a nation that designs, develops, manufactures and increasingly exports advanced defence systems, firmly positioning defence self-reliance as a cornerstone of India’s rise as a strong, secure and self-assured global power. He added that the defence sector has undergone a structural transformation from import dependence to indigenous capability, anchored in the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat and Make in India – Make for the World. In recognition of the momentum achieved, 2025 has been declared the ‘Year of Reforms’ in the Ministry of Defence, marking accelerated progress in defence indigenisation alongside enhanced operational preparedness of the Armed Forces. Shri Naik noted that defence production reached an all-time high of ₹1.54 lakh crore in FY 2024–25, rising from ₹46,429 crore in 2014–15, demonstrating the scale, depth and maturity of India’s indigenous defence manufacturing base. Defence exports surged to a record ₹23,622 crore in FY 2024–25, compared to less than ₹1,000 crore in 2014, underscoring India’s emergence as a credible and competitive global defence supplier. India has supplied a wide spectrum of defence products—including ammunition, arms, sub-systems, complete systems and critical components—to around 80 countries, reaffirming its role as a reliable partner in the global defence supply chain. He further said that the private sector’s contribution has risen to nearly 23% of total defence production, reflecting growing competitiveness, innovation and confidence of Indian industry, while Defence Public Sector Undertakings continue to play a critical role, accounting for about 77% of total defence production within a more accountable and performance-oriented framework. Five Positive Indigenisation Lists, covering over 5,500 items, have been notified, with more than 3,000 items already indigenised, decisively reducing import dependence and strengthening domestic capability. The Minister observed that indigenous platforms such as LCA Tejas, LCH Prachand, ATAGS, Akash missile systems, radars, corvettes, armoured vehicles and drones are significantly enhancing the operational readiness and combat capability of the Armed Forces. Operation Sindoor, executed on the strength of indigenous equipment and systems, marked a milestone in India’s journey towards technological self-reliance in drone warfare, layered air defence and electronic warfare, clearly demonstrating the operational relevance of Atmanirbharta. Shri Naik said that Mission Sudarshan Chakra, announced by Prime Minister Modi from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Independence Day 2025, aims at neutralising enemy defence infiltrations and strengthening India’s offensive and protective capabilities. Inspired by the legendary Sudarshan Chakra of Shri Krishna, the mission symbolises speed, precision and decisive power, underscoring India’s commitment to strategic autonomy and rapid, effective response. Under this mission, an expanded nationwide security shield is envisaged, with enhanced protection of public spaces and critical areas by 2035, reflecting a long-term, self-reliant approach to national security. He informed that defence Industrial Corridors in Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have together attracted investments of over ₹9,145 crore, with 289 MoUs signed, unlocking ₹66,423 crore in potential opportunities. The Defence Procurement Manual 2025, launched in October 2025, simplifies revenue procurement of goods and services worth nearly ₹1 lakh crore, enhancing transparency, uniformity and participation of domestic industry. A comprehensive review of the Defence Acquisition Procedure 2020 has also been initiated to align procurement with national priorities, promote indigenous design and facilitate technology infusion. Talking about allocation in the Union Budget 2025–26, he informed that ₹6.81 lakh crore has been allotted to the Ministry of Defence. This includes ₹1.80 lakh crore allocated for capital outlay, with 75% of the modernisation budget earmarked for domestic procurement, providing strong and sustained demand for Indian manufacturers. Innovations for Defence Excellence has emerged as a key enabler of defence innovation by integrating start-ups, MSMEs and academia into the defence ecosystem, while DRDO continues to drive innovation, supported by a ₹500 crore corpus under the Technology Development Fund and 15 Defence Industry–Academia Centres of Excellence. The restructuring of the Ordnance Factory Board into seven DPSUs has further enhanced autonomy, efficiency and export orientation of legacy defence manufacturing. With over 16,000 MSMEs now part of the defence ecosystem, Atmanirbharta has become a broad-based national endeavour. The Government has set a clear vision of achieving ₹3 lakh crore defence production and ₹50,000 crore defence exports by 2029, positioning India as a global defence manufacturing hub. While concluding, the Minister said that Atmanirbharta in defence today is not an aspiration; it is a measurable and credible reality, reflected in rising production, expanding exports and proven operational capability. As India advances towards becoming a global defence manufacturing hub, this journey will continue to strengthen the Armed Forces, empower Indian industry and reinforce India’s position as a confident, capable and reliable partner in the global security architecture. *** NR/AP (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205873) आगंतुक पटल  : 264 इस विज्ञप्ति को इन भाषाओं में पढ़ें: Urdu , हिन्दी , Gujarati Ministry of Power India’s Atmanirbharta in Defence Emerges as a Measurable and Credible Reality: Shripad Naik Structural reforms, record defence production and exports mark India’s transformation from importer to global defence manufacturer प्रविष्टि तिथि:

                18 DEC 2025 4:30PM by PIB Delhi Freshwater sponges which host diverse microbial communities vital for ecosystem health, have been found to have the potential to act both as bioindicators and absorbents of toxic metals like arsenic, lead, and cadmium and can be a promising solution for bioremediation. As pollution continues to threaten aquatic ecosystems worldwide, nature’s own water purifiers are emerging as powerful allies in the fight for cleaner environments. Freshwater sponges, among the earliest multicellular eukaryotes, filter large volumes of water and are vital for ecosystem health. In a recent study published in Microbiology Spectrum (American Society for Microbiology) scientists from Bose Institute (an autonomous institute of the Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India) studied freshwater sponges from the Sundarban delta and identified their potential to act as bioindicators of toxic metal pollution. Fig: Diagram illustrating metal uptake and accumulation in sponges in situ, along with the diversity of associated bacterial communities capable of heavy-metal resistance and mobilization. Dr. Abhrajyoti Ghosh and his team at the Department of Biological Sciences, showed that sponge-associated microbial communities play a crucial ecological role in detoxifying polluted waters and maintaining ecosystem health. This study, supported by the DST SERB National Post-Doctoral Fellowship awarded to Dr. Dhruba Bhattacharya, is also the first to report on bacterial diversity among the freshwater sponges of Sundarban, providing new insights into an underexplored region. This study revealed that sponge bacterial communities are distinct from the surrounding water, shaped by species and habitat. Importantly, sponges accumulated significantly higher levels of toxic metals like arsenic, lead, and cadmium, highlighting their strong bioaccumulation ability. Given the widespread heavy metal pollution in the Gangetic plain, these sponges offer a promising solution for bioremediation. Beyond mere accumulation, the study uncovered that sponge-associated bacteria are functionally enriched with genes involved in metal ion transport, metal resistance, and antimicrobial resistance. These adaptive features suggest that bacterial symbionts not only survive but actively contribute to detoxifying and resisting environmental stress, especially in metal-contaminated habitats. The research highlights the ecological significance of the sponge-microbe consortium and reinforces the role of freshwater sponges as effective bioindicators for monitoring water quality and pollution levels in estuarine and freshwater ecosystems. This pioneering work published in the journal Microbiology Spectrum broadens our understanding of sponge microbial ecology and opens new avenues for sustainable water quality management and bioremediation strategies. ***** NKR/AK (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205951) आगंतुक पटल  : 152 इस विज्ञप्ति को इन भाषाओं में पढ़ें: Urdu , हिन्दी Ministry of Science & Technology Scientists reveal the importance of sponge-associated microbes in tackling metal pollution प्रविष्टि तिथि:

In a recent study published in Microbiology Spectrum (American Society for Microbiology) scientists from Bose Institute (an autonomous institute of the Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India) studied freshwater sponges from the Sundarban delta and identified their potential to act as bioindicators of toxic metal pollution. Fig: Diagram illustrating metal uptake and accumulation in sponges in situ, along with the diversity of associated bacterial communities capable of heavy-metal resistance and mobilization. Dr. Abhrajyoti Ghosh and his team at the Department of Biological Sciences, showed that sponge-associated microbial communities play a crucial ecological role in detoxifying polluted waters and maintaining ecosystem health. This study, supported by the DST SERB National Post-Doctoral Fellowship awarded to Dr. Dhruba Bhattacharya, is also the first to report on bacterial diversity among the freshwater sponges of Sundarban, providing new insights into an underexplored region. This study revealed that sponge bacterial communities are distinct from the surrounding water, shaped by species and habitat. Importantly, sponges accumulated significantly higher levels of toxic metals like arsenic, lead, and cadmium, highlighting their strong bioaccumulation ability. Given the widespread heavy metal pollution in the Gangetic plain, these sponges offer a promising solution for bioremediation. Beyond mere accumulation, the study uncovered that sponge-associated bacteria are functionally enriched with genes involved in metal ion transport, metal resistance, and antimicrobial resistance. These adaptive features suggest that bacterial symbionts not only survive but actively contribute to detoxifying and resisting environmental stress, especially in metal-contaminated habitats. The research highlights the ecological significance of the sponge-microbe consortium and reinforces the role of freshwater sponges as effective bioindicators for monitoring water quality and pollution levels in estuarine and freshwater ecosystems. This pioneering work published in the journal Microbiology Spectrum broadens our understanding of sponge microbial ecology and opens new avenues for sustainable water quality management and bioremediation strategies. ***** NKR/AK (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205951)","2025-12-18T17:50:06.660135"

                18 DEC 2025 4:28PM by PIB Delhi Researchers have uncovered a surprising player in autophagy or the “self-eating” process that removes damaged parts, fights infections, and keeps long-lived cells like neurons in good working order. Identification of key players in the early steps of autophagosome biogenesis, a key stage in the autophagy pathway, can lay the foundations for modulating the pathway for finding interventions that can restore the pathway in diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson's, and cancer. Just as our homes need regular cleaning, our cells also clear out damaged and unwanted materials through a process called autophagy. When a cell fails to clear waste, its health suffers, especially in long-lived neurons. The autophagy pathway, which removes damaged material and defends against infections, is disrupted in diseases like Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s. Autophagy also has dual roles in cancer: preventing it early on but supporting tumor growth later. Autophagy acts as tumor suppressor by maintaining genome integrity and cellular homeostasis by clearing cellular junk such as protein aggregates and damaged mitochondria. But it is also a double-edged sword as certain types of cancer cells hijack autophagy for their own survival and propagation. Understanding its regulation is crucial for the development of effective therapies. Researchers from Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), an autonomous institution under the Department of Science and Technology (DST) found that a group of proteins called the exocyst complex, which normally helps move important molecules to the cell surface, also plays a key role in autophagy. This complex comprises a team of 8 proteins; interestingly, 7 of the 8 proteins are required to help the cell grow the trash bag so that it can completely wrap up the waste. When this complex is missing, the cell’s bag-making factory stops working properly and even starts producing faulty, non-functional factories. Fig : An autophagosome engulfing its cargo. In this microscopic image, an autophagosome, shown in green, attempts to wrap around a protein aggregate, shown in magenta. The size is around 1-2 microns. The researchers led by Prof. Ravi Manjithaya used simple yeast cells to elucidate the formation of autophagosomes (cellular “trash bags”), thereby providing insights into how this vital process operates in higher organisms. They elucidated the mechanism by which a protein complex exocyst, previously recognized for its role in secretion, also contributes to the autophagy pathway, which is crucial for maintaining cellular health. Since defects in autophagy are linked to several neurodegenerative diseases and cancers, the findings published in,” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences”, have opened new avenues for modulating this pathway to restore cellular balance and develop potential therapeutic.

                        18 DEC 2025 3:52PM by PIB Delhi Identification, development and promotion of tourist destinations and tourism products including PPP collaborations is primarily undertaken by the respective State Government/ Union Territory (UT) Administration.  The Ministry of Tourism in 2014-15 launched its Swadesh Darshan (SD) scheme with the idea to develop tourism infrastructure under identified thematic circuits in the country for development of tourism infrastructure and experiences. The details of the projects of Tourism Circuits sanctioned under Swadesh Darshan scheme in the country including North Eastern States is annexed as Annexure-I. Swadesh Darshan scheme has now been revamped as Swadesh Darshan 2.0 (SD2.0) with the idea to develop sustainable and responsible tourism destinations. The Ministry also provides financial assistance to the State Governments/ UT Administrations under its ‘Challenge Based Destination Development (CBDD)’, a sub-scheme of Swadesh Darshan 2.0 for development of tourism infrastructure and experiences. The details of the projects sanctioned under SD2.0 and CBDD schemes in the country including North Eastern States is annexed as Annexure - II . Also, Ministry under ‘Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual Heritage Augmentation Drive (PRASHAD)’ provides financial assistance to the State Governments/UT Administrations for development of tourism infrastructure and experiences. The details of the projects sanctioned under PRASHAD scheme in the country including North Eastern States is annexed as Annexure - III . Government of India under its ‘Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment (SASCI) – Development of Iconic Tourist Centres to Global Scale’ also sanctioned 40 projects in the country, with the primary objective to comprehensively develop iconic tourist centres in the country, branding and marketing them at global scale. As per the SASCI scheme guidelines, the projects are implemented and managed by the concerned State Government and projects are to be developed and completed within maximum 2 year’s period, whereas Government of India will release funds under this scheme up to 31 st March, 2026. The details of the projects sanctioned under SASCI scheme in the country including North Eastern States is annexed as Annexure - IV . With the aim to promote tourism in tribal areas, the Ministry of Tourism has recently issued guidelines along with template for formulation of proposal by State Governments and UT Administrations for 'Development of Homestays in Tribal Areas' (A sub-scheme of Swadesh Darshan Scheme) under Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PMJUGA). The objective of the initiative is to develop homestays in tribal areas to promote responsible tourism and enhance livelihood opportunities for tribal communities. However, Ministry of Tourism does not maintain details of measurable socio-economic outcomes that the rural tourism enterprises, like homestays, nature-trail clusters and community-based tourism programmes, have produced, particularly in terms of increase in family income and employment generation. This information was given by Union Minister for Tourism and Culture Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today. **** Sunil Kumar Tiwari tourism4pib[at]gmail[dot]com ANNEXURE-I The list of the projects sanctioned under Swadesh Darshan scheme S.

                18 DEC 2025 3:51PM by PIB Delhi Identification, development and promotion of tourist destinations including spiritual destinations and temples is primarily undertaken by the respective State Government/Union Territory (UT) Administration. However, the Ministry of Tourism through its various schemes provides financial assistance to the State Governments (SGs)/UT Administrations (UTAs) to complement these efforts by sanctioning projects, on receipt of the detailed project proposals (DPRs) from them in line with the scheme guidelines, Government instructions, inter-se-priority and availability of budget etc. The Ministry of Tourism in 2014-15 launched its Swadesh Darshan (SD) scheme with the idea to develop tourism infrastructure under identified thematic circuits such as Spiritual, Buddhist, Krishna, Ramayana, Tirthankar etc. in the country. This scheme has now been revamped as Swadesh Darshan 2.0 (SD2.0) with the objective to develop sustainable and responsible tourism destinations. The Ministry also provides financial assistance to the State Governments/ UT Administrations under its ‘Challenge Based Destination Development (CBDD)’, a sub-scheme of Swadesh Darshan. Further, the Ministry in 2014-15 also launched ‘Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual Heritage Augmentation Drive (PRASHAD)’ with the objective of integrated development at identified pilgrimage & heritage destinations. In addition, Government of India under its ‘Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment (SASCI) – Development of Iconic Tourist Centres to Global Scale’ also sanctioned 40 projects in the country, with the primary objective to comprehensively develop iconic tourist centres in the country, branding and marketing them at global scale. For projects sanctioned at pilgrimage and spiritual destinations under the aforesaid schemes, Ministry of Tourism provides financial assistance to State Governments and Union Territory Administrations for development of required facilities for construction and upgradation of approach roads and parking facilities; development of essential amenities such as landscaping, pathways, CCTV, illumination and gazebos; and creation of tourist facilitation infrastructure, including multi-cuisine food courts with souvenir shops, waiting lounges, etc. The details of the projects sanctioned under aforesaid schemes including those at pilgrimage and spiritual destinations is annexed . Ministry of Tourism does not maintain specific data in respect of number of pilgrims visits. However, Ministry of Tourism collects and compiles data on Domestic Tourist Visits (DTVs) from States/UTs, which also include visits undertaken for pilgrimage purposes. The details of Domestic Tourist Visits (DTVs) during 2019 to 2024 are given below: Year DTVs (in Million) 2019 2321.98 2020 610.22 2021 677.63 2022 1731.01 2023 2508.82 2024 2948.19 Source : State/UT Tourism Departments This information was given by Union Minister for Tourism and Culture Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today. ***** Sunil Kumar Tiwari tourism4pib[at]gmail[dot]com ANNEXURE The list of the projects sanctioned under Swadesh Darshan scheme S.N.

                        18 DEC 2025 3:51PM by PIB Delhi Identification, development and promotion of tourist destinations including spiritual destinations and temples is primarily undertaken by the respective State Government/Union Territory (UT) Administration. However, the Ministry of Tourism through its various schemes provides financial assistance to the State Governments (SGs)/UT Administrations (UTAs) to complement these efforts by sanctioning projects, on receipt of the detailed project proposals (DPRs) from them in line with the scheme guidelines, Government instructions, inter-se-priority and availability of budget etc. The Ministry of Tourism in 2014-15 launched its Swadesh Darshan (SD) scheme with the idea to develop tourism infrastructure under identified thematic circuits such as Spiritual, Buddhist, Krishna, Ramayana, Tirthankar etc. in the country. This scheme has now been revamped as Swadesh Darshan 2.0 (SD2.0) with the objective to develop sustainable and responsible tourism destinations. The Ministry also provides financial assistance to the State Governments/ UT Administrations under its ‘Challenge Based Destination Development (CBDD)’, a sub-scheme of Swadesh Darshan. Further, the Ministry in 2014-15 also launched ‘Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual Heritage Augmentation Drive (PRASHAD)’ with the objective of integrated development at identified pilgrimage & heritage destinations. In addition, Government of India under its ‘Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment (SASCI) – Development of Iconic Tourist Centres to Global Scale’ also sanctioned 40 projects in the country, with the primary objective to comprehensively develop iconic tourist centres in the country, branding and marketing them at global scale. For projects sanctioned at pilgrimage and spiritual destinations under the aforesaid schemes, Ministry of Tourism provides financial assistance to State Governments and Union Territory Administrations for development of required facilities for construction and upgradation of approach roads and parking facilities; development of essential amenities such as landscaping, pathways, CCTV, illumination and gazebos; and creation of tourist facilitation infrastructure, including multi-cuisine food courts with souvenir shops, waiting lounges, etc. The details of the projects sanctioned under aforesaid schemes including those at pilgrimage and spiritual destinations is annexed . Ministry of Tourism does not maintain specific data in respect of number of pilgrims visits. However, Ministry of Tourism collects and compiles data on Domestic Tourist Visits (DTVs) from States/UTs, which also include visits undertaken for pilgrimage purposes. The details of Domestic Tourist Visits (DTVs) during 2019 to 2024 are given below: Year DTVs (in Million) 2019 2321.98 2020 610.22 2021 677.63 2022 1731.01 2023 2508.82 2024 2948.19 Source : State/UT Tourism Departments This information was given by Union Minister for Tourism and Culture Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today. ***** Sunil Kumar Tiwari tourism4pib[at]gmail[dot]com ANNEXURE The list of the projects sanctioned under Swadesh Darshan scheme S.N.

                18 DEC 2025 7:17PM by PIB Delhi Key Takeaways Between November 2024 and November 2025, India’s total exports rose from US$ 64.05 billion to US$ 73.99 billion, registering a strong 15.52% growth. India has inked a series of major Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), the most recent being the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with Oman. Active negotiations ongoing with several other countries. Export diversification is further poised to strengthen trade stability, competitiveness, and long-term economic security amid global uncertainties. India’s Trade Story at a Glance Driven by diversification, innovation, and strategic trade reforms, India continues to strengthen its position in global markets. From strong post-pandemic recovery to enduring global uncertainties, India’s exports are not just growing, they are setting new benchmarks. The year-on-year rise from November 2024 to November 2025 highlights India as a trusted and reliable partner in global trade . Between November 2024 and November 2025, India’s total exports rose from US$ 64.05 billion to US$ 73.99 billion , registering a strong 15.52% growth , while imports remained largely stable at US$ 80.63 billion. Consequently, the trade deficit narrowed significantly by 61.07% , from US$ 17.06 billion to US$ 6.64 billion.Despite trade disruption, this growth reflects India’s resilience, with high-value commodities, widening global partnerships, and policy reforms supporting a more balanced and globally integrated trade trajectory. For export growth India is also focused on enhancing its international trade relations. India's trade agreements with other economies reinforces its commitment to inclusive growth, benefiting farmers, artisans, workers, MSMEs while safeguarding core national interests. Most recently, the India–Oman agreement builds on long standing bilateral ties, creating a forward looking and balanced economic framework. Powering Global Trade: India’s Export Journey India’s exports recorded year-on-year growth in November 2025, reflecting sustained momentum in external trade. The increase was supported by higher export values across key merchandise and services sectors, alongside steady demand from major partner countries. This performance underscores the resilience of India’s export sector amid evolving global trade conditions. Merchandise exports during November 2025 were US$ 38.13 Billion as compared to US$ 31.94 Billion in November 2024, registering a growth of 19.38% over the year. Services export for November 2025 is US$ 35.86 Billion as compared to US$ 32.11 Billion in November 2024, indicating growth of 11.67% in a year. The share of merchandise exports was 51.53%, whereas service exports constituted 48.47% share in total exports in November 2025. Readymade garments of all textiles , a labor-intensive sector, continue to contribute positively. Exports rose to USD 1247.37 Million with 11.27% increase in November 2025 compared to last year.Some of the large export markets for India which clocked impressive growth rates were UAE (14.5%), UK (1.5%), Japan (19.0%), Germany (2.9%), Spain (9.0%) and France (9.2%). On the other hand, some of the other markets that recorded higher growth rates were Egypt (27%), Saudi Arabia (12.5%), Hong Kong (69%) etc. This performance highlights the sector’s adaptability and competitiveness in the face of global uncertainties. Similarly, Organic and Inorganic Chemicals exports grew by 18.49% over the year in November 2025. India’s drugs and pharmaceutical sector which is recognised as the Pharmacy of the World,  experienced 20.19% growth in exports over the year. Indian pharma exports are destined to more than 200 countries around the globe including highly regulated markets of US, West Europe, Japan and Australia indicating diversification in this sector too. Export of Gems and Jewellery also registered a growth of 27.8% in November, 2025. Indian jewellery is admired for its craftsmanship, design, and cultural richness. Demand is growing in key markets such as the United States, United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, and Europe, especially for gold, diamond, and coloured gemstone jewellery. India has witnessed a remarkable surge in petroleum product exports over the last decade. India is the seventh-largest exporter of refined petroleum products and ranks among the top five refining nations globally, due to its robust infrastructure and strategic geographic location. The export growth in November 2025 was 11.65% when compared from the corresponding year in the last year. Key export destinations include South Asian, African, and European countries. Engineering goods , a traditional pillar of India’s exports, have recorded steady growth, with the US as the top destination, followed by the UAE, Germany, the UK, and Saudi Arabia. To sustain momentum, the government has rolled out measures such as Zero Duty EPCG and the Market Access Initiative (MAI) to support exporters and boost overseas revenues. With a target of building a $500 billion domestic electronics ecosystem by 2030-31 , India is now firmly on track to become a global leader in electronic design, manufacturing, and exports. Leading the way are mobile phones from just ₹1,500 crore in 2014-15, mobile phone exports reached ₹2 lakh crore in 2024-25, growing 127 times in a single decade. Indian electronics goods are now exported to major markets, with the top five destinations in FY 2024-25 being the United States, United Arab Emirates, Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Italy. Export Diversification: A Strategic Approach Export diversification has emerged as a deliberate policy strategy. It helps navigate uncertain global trade environments marked by geopolitical tensions, demand volatility, and supply chain disruptions. By expanding across products and markets, countries reduce overdependence on limited partners and build resilience against external shocks. This approach strengthens trade stability, competitiveness, and long-term economic security amid global uncertainties. Avoiding export instability and reducing dependency Commodity dependent exports are inherently exposed to sharp price fluctuations, which can lead to instability in export earnings if countries rely on a narrow set of products. Such volatility may heighten macroeconomic uncertainty and dampen long-term investment decisions. Export diversification offers a pathway to greater stability by spreading risk across products and markets, thereby supporting sustained export growth and long-term economic resilience . Building resilience against global demand shocks Building resilience against global demand shocks is crucial, as limited export diversification can leave economies vulnerable to sudden downturns in global demand. Diversifying exports enhances the ability to absorb such economic shocks by spreading risk across sectors and markets, thereby ensuring greater stability in export performance. Encouraging knowledge spillover Export diversification fosters flow of ideas, skills, and information by encouraging the adoption of new production techniques, management practices, and marketing capabilities that can diffuse across industries. By expanding the range of export products, economies strengthen learning, innovation, and productivity, supporting higher per capita income growth over the long term. Strengthening macroeconomic stability Exports alone accounted for 21.2% of India’s GDP in 2024. Limited diversification can expose the economy to global uncertainties and export shortfalls, affecting macroeconomic stability. Export diversification strengthens stability by broadening economic activity, reducing vulnerability to external shocks, and supporting sustainable growth and improved living standards. Expanding Global Ties: Unlocking Trade Opportunities for India As India’s economic footprint continues to expand worldwide, it has emerged as a preferred partner for deeper trade and economic collaboration. India and Oman sign CEPA: India’s 2nd FTA in the last 6 months after UK DID YOU KNOW? Oman is a key pillar of India’s West Asia Policy and India’s oldest strategic partner in the region. The strong economic partnership is reflected in 6,000+ India–Oman joint ventures operating in Oman. India signed a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with Oman on 18 December 2025, marking a significant step in strengthening economic engagement with the Gulf region, as the two countries commemorate 70 years of diplomatic relations. The agreement underscores India’s growing stature as a trusted and dependable global trade partner. The agreement opens new export opportunities for India’s labour-intensive sectors- such as agriculture, textiles, leather, gems and jewellery, engineering, pharmaceuticals, and automobiles- supporting job creation and empowering artisans, women-led enterprises, and MSMEs. India held a 10.24% share in Oman’s agricultural imports in 2024, ranking second among suppliers. Major export items include Basmati rice, parboiled rice, bananas, potatoes, onions, meal of soyabean, sweet biscuits, cashew kernels, mixed condiments, butter, fish body oil, prawn & shrimps feed, frozen boneless bovine meat, and fertilized eggs. Duty free access to boneless meat of bovine animals, other fresh eggs, sweet biscuits, cashew kernels, other fats & oils derived from milk, other mixed condiments & seasonings, prepared/preserved potatoes, other egg yolks not dried, guar gum, kabuli chana and other cheese provide a competitive edge over other countries exporting to Oman. Elimination of the tariff from butter, sugar confectionery, bakery products, poultry meat & offal, mixed condiments & mixed seasoning, other fruit squash prepared/preserved, natural honey strengthens India’s position in Oman’s market. CEPA offers unprecedented market access for Indian goods with zero-duty access on 98.08% of Oman’s tariff lines, covering 99.38% of India’s exports by value. It marks the first-ever commitment by any country on traditional medicine across all modes opening significant opportunities for India’s wellness sectors and AYUSH , which anchors India’s traditional medicine sector through a comprehensive institutional framework. For the first time, Oman has offered commitments across key mode 4 categories , high quality temporary entry and temporary stay commitments for intra-corporate transferees, and contractual service suppliers, business visitors and independent professionals and liberalised entry and stay for professionals in accountancy, taxation, architecture, medical and allied sectors. Besides, India has signed a series of major Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with global economies, strengthening its position in international trade and opening new markets for Indian businesses. India concluded a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with the United Kingdom in 2025. CETA provides an unprecedented duty-free access to 99% of India’s exports to the UK, covering nearly 100% of the trade value, benefiting sectors such as textiles, leather, marine products, gems, engineering goods, chemicals, and auto components. Notably, the agreement goes beyond goods and addresses services , a core strength of India’s economy. India exported over US$ 19.8 billion in services to the UK in 2023, and CETA promises to expand this further. Additionally, in a first by UK, mobility for professionals across IT, healthcare, finance, and education is being eased with CETA. This offers streamlined entry for contractual service suppliers, business visitors, intra-corporate transferees, independent professionals. Another major breakthrough is the Double Contribution Convention - that will save Indian firms and workers ₹4,000+ crore by removing the need for dual social security contributions. Marking its first FTA with four developed European nations, India signed a trade and economic partnership agreement with the EFTA countries- Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein - in 2024. The agreement improves market access for Indian pharmaceuticals, engineering goods, and services, backed by strong investment commitments, including USD 100 billion in investment and the creation of one million jobs in India. India’s Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with the United Arab Emirates , signed in 2022, has substantially reduced tariffs on over 90%of Indian exports- particularly in gems and jewellery, textiles, leather, and engineering goods- supporting the target of exceeding $100 billion in bilateral trade. With Australia, India concluded the Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (ECTA) in 2022, eliminating or reducing tariffs on most traded goods. The agreement has opened the Australian market to Indian textiles, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and agriculture. In Africa , India signed its first trade pact with the continent through the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation and Partnership Agreement (CECPA) with Mauritius in 2021. The agreement enables easier market access for Indian exporters while strengthening Mauritius’ role as a gateway to African markets. Besides these concluded agreements, several major economies are currently engaged in active negotiations with India to deepen trade and investment ties through FTAs and comprehensive economic partnerships. India and Israel signed the Terms of Reference for an FTA in November 2025. The proposed pact is expected to deepen cooperation in sectors such as fintech, agri-tech, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, machine learning, pharmaceuticals, space and defence. India and the United States continue discussions on a bilateral trade agreement, with rounds of talks held in 2025. Under the ambitious ""Mission 500"", both countries aim to more than double US-India trade to $500 billion by 2030 to be achieved by deepening the trade relationship across multiple sectors. India is also in discussion with European Union (EU) for an FTA. Technical discussions on key chapters of the FTA such as market access for goods, rules of origin, services, technical barriers to trade, trade and sustainable development etc. took place in December 2025. Discussions for the ASEAN -India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) is also underway, which holds potential to unleash the full economic potential of the member countries and further strengthen regional cooperation. The India- Australia Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) negotiations are advancing, covering a wide range of areas including goods, services and mobility, digital trade, rules of origin, legal and institutional provisions, environment, labour, and gender, bringing greater understanding for convergence in the remaining provisions. India and Mexico meetings have been centered on strengthening bilateral trade and investment relations, with discussions focused on expanding trade, investment, expanding economic cooperation, fostering business collaborations, and exploring opportunities across diverse sectors. Negotiations are also underway with New Zealand for an FTA or Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement with key tracks including trade in goods, trade in services, economic and trade cooperation, and rules of origin. The proposed FTA is expected to significantly enhance trade flows, deepen investment linkages, strengthen supply-chain resilience, and provide greater predictability and market access for businesses. With Canada , India continues discussions on a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, supported by agreed terms of reference. The proposed agreement aims to raise bilateral trade to around $50 billion by 2030 through tariff reductions and clearer frameworks for services and investment. India is actively negotiating an FTA with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and exploring a similar arrangement with Qatar , with the objective of strengthening ties across trade, energy, investment, and security. The expanding network of concluded agreements and ongoing negotiations reflects a broader shift in India’s international economic engagement. Together, these partnerships position India to play a central role in shaping contemporary trade architectures anchored in mutual growth, resilience, and strategic trust. Boosting India’s Export Competitiveness The Government has implemented a comprehensive set of policy and institutional measures to strengthen India’s export ecosystem. These measures are strengthening India’s export competitiveness and integration with global markets. Export Promotion Mission The Export Promotion Mission , was approved on 12 November, 2025, with a total outlay of Rs.25,060 crore for FY 2025–26 to FY 2030–31. The mission operates through two integrated sub-schemes, Niryat Protsahan and Niryat Disha . Niryat Protsahan focuses on improving access to affordable trade finance for MSMEs through a range of instruments. Niryat Disha focuses on non-financial enablers that enhance market readiness and competitiveness, such as export quality and compliance support, assistance for international branding, packaging and others. Labour Reforms The integration of 29 labour laws into four Labour Codes has streamlined compliance, enhanced industrial efficiency, and strengthened worker protection. The reforms provide export-oriented industries with simplified regulations, flexible hiring provisions, unified registrations and returns, and expanded social security coverage, while ensuring occupational safety and welfare. At the same time, workers benefit from universal minimum wages, timely and transparent wage payments, mandatory appointment letters, grievance redressal mechanisms, and comprehensive social security protection. Next Gen GST 2.0 Reforms Since 22 September 2025, Next Gen GST 2.0 reforms have come into effect. 90% provisional refunds for zero rated supplies and inverted duty structure claims are being provided on a system driven, risk-based basis. The removal of value-based threshold limits for GST refunds on exports supports small exporters by enabling refund claims on low-value consignments. GST rate reductions across packaging materials, textiles, leather, wood, trucks, delivery vans, toys, and sports goods lower production, freight, and logistics costs, enhance export competitiveness, and support domestic manufacturing. Further, revised place of supply rules for “intermediary services” enables Indian service exporters to claim export related benefits, while correction of inverted duty structures in textiles and food processing eases working capital pressures and reduces refund dependency. India’s other export promotion schemes comprise targeted government initiatives to reduce costs, strengthen infrastructure, improve quality standards, and enhance export competitiveness. The Foreign Trade Policy 2023 provides incentive-based support, promotes market diversification, and enables closure of legacy authorisations, while the RoDTEP (Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products) scheme reimburses embedded duties and taxes, with ₹58,000 crore disbursed up to March 2025. Export ecosystems are being strengthened through the initiatives such as Districts as Export Hubs which are making states and districts active players in trade. 734 districts have been identified with export potential while District Export Action Plans (DEAP) has been prepared for 590 districts. The role of Special Economic Zones is also significant in the trade promotion, as it recorded exports of ₹14.56 lakh crore in FY 2024–25. Infrastructure and manufacturing competitiveness are being enhanced through the Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) , PM GatiShakti , the National Logistics Policy . The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, launched in 2020 is boosting manufacturing across 14 sectors, has attracted ₹1.76 lakh crore investments, generated ₹16.5 lakh crore in output, and created over 12 lakh jobs by March 2025. Further support is being provided through ease of doing business reforms and digital trade platforms such as the National Single Window System , Trade Connect e-Platform , E-Commerce Export Hubs , and ICEGATE . Conclusion India’s export performance between over the recent years reflects steady momentum, marked by diversification across products and markets and a balanced contribution from merchandise and services exports. The export basket recorded higher export values across major commodities. The export growth was accompanied by deeper engagement with key partner countries and emerging markets, supported by continued policy and procedural reforms. Together, these trends underscore India’s evolving export profile and its deepening integration with global trade networks.

With a target of building a $500 billion domestic electronics ecosystem by 2030-31 , India is now firmly on track to become a global leader in electronic design, manufacturing, and exports. Leading the way are mobile phones from just ₹1,500 crore in 2014-15, mobile phone exports reached ₹2 lakh crore in 2024-25, growing 127 times in a single decade. Indian electronics goods are now exported to major markets, with the top five destinations in FY 2024-25 being the United States, United Arab Emirates, Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Italy. Export Diversification: A Strategic Approach Export diversification has emerged as a deliberate policy strategy. It helps navigate uncertain global trade environments marked by geopolitical tensions, demand volatility, and supply chain disruptions. By expanding across products and markets, countries reduce overdependence on limited partners and build resilience against external shocks. This approach strengthens trade stability, competitiveness, and long-term economic security amid global uncertainties. Avoiding export instability and reducing dependency Commodity dependent exports are inherently exposed to sharp price fluctuations, which can lead to instability in export earnings if countries rely on a narrow set of products. Such volatility may heighten macroeconomic uncertainty and dampen long-term investment decisions. Export diversification offers a pathway to greater stability by spreading risk across products and markets, thereby supporting sustained export growth and long-term economic resilience . Building resilience against global demand shocks Building resilience against global demand shocks is crucial, as limited export diversification can leave economies vulnerable to sudden downturns in global demand. Diversifying exports enhances the ability to absorb such economic shocks by spreading risk across sectors and markets, thereby ensuring greater stability in export performance. Encouraging knowledge spillover Export diversification fosters flow of ideas, skills, and information by encouraging the adoption of new production techniques, management practices, and marketing capabilities that can diffuse across industries. By expanding the range of export products, economies strengthen learning, innovation, and productivity, supporting higher per capita income growth over the long term. Strengthening macroeconomic stability Exports alone accounted for 21.2% of India’s GDP in 2024. Limited diversification can expose the economy to global uncertainties and export shortfalls, affecting macroeconomic stability. Export diversification strengthens stability by broadening economic activity, reducing vulnerability to external shocks, and supporting sustainable growth and improved living standards. Expanding Global Ties: Unlocking Trade Opportunities for India As India’s economic footprint continues to expand worldwide, it has emerged as a preferred partner for deeper trade and economic collaboration. India and Oman sign CEPA: India’s 2nd FTA in the last 6 months after UK DID YOU KNOW? Oman is a key pillar of India’s West Asia Policy and India’s oldest strategic partner in the region. The strong economic partnership is reflected in 6,000+ India–Oman joint ventures operating in Oman. India signed a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with Oman on 18 December 2025, marking a significant step in strengthening economic engagement with the Gulf region, as the two countries commemorate 70 years of diplomatic relations. The agreement underscores India’s growing stature as a trusted and dependable global trade partner. The agreement opens new export opportunities for India’s labour-intensive sectors- such as agriculture, textiles, leather, gems and jewellery, engineering, pharmaceuticals, and automobiles- supporting job creation and empowering artisans, women-led enterprises, and MSMEs. India held a 10.24% share in Oman’s agricultural imports in 2024, ranking second among suppliers. Major export items include Basmati rice, parboiled rice, bananas, potatoes, onions, meal of soyabean, sweet biscuits, cashew kernels, mixed condiments, butter, fish body oil, prawn & shrimps feed, frozen boneless bovine meat, and fertilized eggs. Duty free access to boneless meat of bovine animals, other fresh eggs, sweet biscuits, cashew kernels, other fats & oils derived from milk, other mixed condiments & seasonings, prepared/preserved potatoes, other egg yolks not dried, guar gum, kabuli chana and other cheese provide a competitive edge over other countries exporting to Oman. Elimination of the tariff from butter, sugar confectionery, bakery products, poultry meat & offal, mixed condiments & mixed seasoning, other fruit squash prepared/preserved, natural honey strengthens India’s position in Oman’s market. CEPA offers unprecedented market access for Indian goods with zero-duty access on 98.08% of Oman’s tariff lines, covering 99.38% of India’s exports by value. It marks the first-ever commitment by any country on traditional medicine across all modes opening significant opportunities for India’s wellness sectors and AYUSH , which anchors India’s traditional medicine sector through a comprehensive institutional framework. For the first time, Oman has offered commitments across key mode 4 categories , high quality temporary entry and temporary stay commitments for intra-corporate transferees, and contractual service suppliers, business visitors and independent professionals and liberalised entry and stay for professionals in accountancy, taxation, architecture, medical and allied sectors. Besides, India has signed a series of major Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with global economies, strengthening its position in international trade and opening new markets for Indian businesses. India concluded a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with the United Kingdom in 2025. CETA provides an unprecedented duty-free access to 99% of India’s exports to the UK, covering nearly 100% of the trade value, benefiting sectors such as textiles, leather, marine products, gems, engineering goods, chemicals, and auto components. Notably, the agreement goes beyond goods and addresses services , a core strength of India’s economy. India exported over US$ 19.8 billion in services to the UK in 2023, and CETA promises to expand this further. Additionally, in a first by UK, mobility for professionals across IT, healthcare, finance, and education is being eased with CETA. This offers streamlined entry for contractual service suppliers, business visitors, intra-corporate transferees, independent professionals. Another major breakthrough is the Double Contribution Convention - that will save Indian firms and workers ₹4,000+ crore by removing the need for dual social security contributions. Marking its first FTA with four developed European nations, India signed a trade and economic partnership agreement with the EFTA countries- Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein - in 2024. The agreement improves market access for Indian pharmaceuticals, engineering goods, and services, backed by strong investment commitments, including USD 100 billion in investment and the creation of one million jobs in India. India’s Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with the United Arab Emirates , signed in 2022, has substantially reduced tariffs on over 90%of Indian exports- particularly in gems and jewellery, textiles, leather, and engineering goods- supporting the target of exceeding $100 billion in bilateral trade. With Australia, India concluded the Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (ECTA) in 2022, eliminating or reducing tariffs on most traded goods. The agreement has opened the Australian market to Indian textiles, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and agriculture. In Africa , India signed its first trade pact with the continent through the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation and Partnership Agreement (CECPA) with Mauritius in 2021. The agreement enables easier market access for Indian exporters while strengthening Mauritius’ role as a gateway to African markets. Besides these concluded agreements, several major economies are currently engaged in active negotiations with India to deepen trade and investment ties through FTAs and comprehensive economic partnerships. India and Israel signed the Terms of Reference for an FTA in November 2025. The proposed pact is expected to deepen cooperation in sectors such as fintech, agri-tech, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, machine learning, pharmaceuticals, space and defence. India and the United States continue discussions on a bilateral trade agreement, with rounds of talks held in 2025. Under the ambitious ""Mission 500"", both countries aim to more than double US-India trade to $500 billion by 2030 to be achieved by deepening the trade relationship across multiple sectors. India is also in discussion with European Union (EU) for an FTA. Technical discussions on key chapters of the FTA such as market access for goods, rules of origin, services, technical barriers to trade, trade and sustainable development etc. took place in December 2025. Discussions for the ASEAN -India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) is also underway, which holds potential to unleash the full economic potential of the member countries and further strengthen regional cooperation. The India- Australia Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) negotiations are advancing, covering a wide range of areas including goods, services and mobility, digital trade, rules of origin, legal and institutional provisions, environment, labour, and gender, bringing greater understanding for convergence in the remaining provisions. India and Mexico meetings have been centered on strengthening bilateral trade and investment relations, with discussions focused on expanding trade, investment, expanding economic cooperation, fostering business collaborations, and exploring opportunities across diverse sectors. Negotiations are also underway with New Zealand for an FTA or Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement with key tracks including trade in goods, trade in services, economic and trade cooperation, and rules of origin. The proposed FTA is expected to significantly enhance trade flows, deepen investment linkages, strengthen supply-chain resilience, and provide greater predictability and market access for businesses. With Canada , India continues discussions on a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, supported by agreed terms of reference. The proposed agreement aims to raise bilateral trade to around $50 billion by 2030 through tariff reductions and clearer frameworks for services and investment. India is actively negotiating an FTA with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and exploring a similar arrangement with Qatar , with the objective of strengthening ties across trade, energy, investment, and security. The expanding network of concluded agreements and ongoing negotiations reflects a broader shift in India’s international economic engagement. Together, these partnerships position India to play a central role in shaping contemporary trade architectures anchored in mutual growth, resilience, and strategic trust. Boosting India’s Export Competitiveness The Government has implemented a comprehensive set of policy and institutional measures to strengthen India’s export ecosystem. These measures are strengthening India’s export competitiveness and integration with global markets. Export Promotion Mission The Export Promotion Mission , was approved on 12 November, 2025, with a total outlay of Rs.25,060 crore for FY 2025–26 to FY 2030–31. The mission operates through two integrated sub-schemes, Niryat Protsahan and Niryat Disha . Niryat Protsahan focuses on improving access to affordable trade finance for MSMEs through a range of instruments. Niryat Disha focuses on non-financial enablers that enhance market readiness and competitiveness, such as export quality and compliance support, assistance for international branding, packaging and others. Labour Reforms The integration of 29 labour laws into four Labour Codes has streamlined compliance, enhanced industrial efficiency, and strengthened worker protection. The reforms provide export-oriented industries with simplified regulations, flexible hiring provisions, unified registrations and returns, and expanded social security coverage, while ensuring occupational safety and welfare. At the same time, workers benefit from universal minimum wages, timely and transparent wage payments, mandatory appointment letters, grievance redressal mechanisms, and comprehensive social security protection. Next Gen GST 2.0 Reforms Since 22 September 2025, Next Gen GST 2.0 reforms have come into effect. 90% provisional refunds for zero rated supplies and inverted duty structure claims are being provided on a system driven, risk-based basis. The removal of value-based threshold limits for GST refunds on exports supports small exporters by enabling refund claims on low-value consignments. GST rate reductions across packaging materials, textiles, leather, wood, trucks, delivery vans, toys, and sports goods lower production, freight, and logistics costs, enhance export competitiveness, and support domestic manufacturing. Further, revised place of supply rules for “intermediary services” enables Indian service exporters to claim export related benefits, while correction of inverted duty structures in textiles and food processing eases working capital pressures and reduces refund dependency. India’s other export promotion schemes comprise targeted government initiatives to reduce costs, strengthen infrastructure, improve quality standards, and enhance export competitiveness. The Foreign Trade Policy 2023 provides incentive-based support, promotes market diversification, and enables closure of legacy authorisations, while the RoDTEP (Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products) scheme reimburses embedded duties and taxes, with ₹58,000 crore disbursed up to March 2025. Export ecosystems are being strengthened through the initiatives such as Districts as Export Hubs which are making states and districts active players in trade. 734 districts have been identified with export potential while District Export Action Plans (DEAP) has been prepared for 590 districts. The role of Special Economic Zones is also significant in the trade promotion, as it recorded exports of ₹14.56 lakh crore in FY 2024–25. Infrastructure and manufacturing competitiveness are being enhanced through the Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) , PM GatiShakti , the National Logistics Policy . The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, launched in 2020 is boosting manufacturing across 14 sectors, has attracted ₹1.76 lakh crore investments, generated ₹16.5 lakh crore in output, and created over 12 lakh jobs by March 2025. Further support is being provided through ease of doing business reforms and digital trade platforms such as the National Single Window System , Trade Connect e-Platform , E-Commerce Export Hubs , and ICEGATE . Conclusion India’s export performance between over the recent years reflects steady momentum, marked by diversification across products and markets and a balanced contribution from merchandise and services exports. The export basket recorded higher export values across major commodities. The export growth was accompanied by deeper engagement with key partner countries and emerging markets, supported by continued policy and procedural reforms. Together, these trends underscore India’s evolving export profile and its deepening integration with global trade networks.

                19 DEC 2025 12:34PM by PIB Delhi The President of India, Smt Droupadi Murmu, inaugurated the National Conference for the Chairpersons of Public Service Commissions, being organised by the Telangana Public Service Commission, at Hyderabad, Telangana today (December 19, 2025). Speaking on the occasion, the President said that our Constitution makers dedicated an entire part of the Constitution to Services and Public Service Commissions. This highlights the significance they attached to the roles and functions of the Public Service Commissions for the Union and for the States. The President said that our Constitutional ideals of social, economic and political justice, and equality of status and of opportunity are most pertinent to the functioning of the Public Service Commissions. The Preamble of the Constitution, the Fundamental Right of equality of opportunity in matters of public employment and the Directive Principle guiding the State to secure a social order for the promotion of welfare of the people indicate the pathways for the Public Service Commissions. The Public Service Commissions should not only be guided by the ideal of equality of opportunity but should also try to achieve the goal of equality of outcomes. The Commissions are change-agents which promote equality and equity. The President said that impartiality, continuity and stability are imparted to the process of governance by what is called the ‘permanent executive’ or the body of public servants selected by the Public Service Commissions. Integrity, sensitivity and competence of the civil servants constituting the permanent executive are of utmost importance for implementing the people-oriented policies at national and state levels. She stated that Public Service Commissions should give highest priority to the aspect of honesty and integrity of the candidates they recruit. Honesty and integrity are paramount as well as non-negotiable. She underlined that lack of skills and competencies can be dealt with through learning interventions and several other strategies. But lack of integrity may cause grave challenges which may be impossible to overcome. The President said that young people seeking employment as civil servants should have the inclination to work for the marginalised and the vulnerable. Our civil servants should be particularly sensitive to the needs and aspirations of women. Gender-sensitisation should be given high priority by Public Service Commissions. The President said that India, as the world’s fastest growing major economy and also a nation marked by enormous diversity, needs most effective governance systems at all levels. The country is aiming to be the third largest economy in the world in the near future. We are also moving towards achieving the goal of ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047. She expressed confidence that the Public Service Commissions will continue to fulfil their responsibilities and contribute towards building a future-ready team of civil servants selected and guided by them.

Post Ofﬁce Passport Seva Kendras In view of greater mobility of the Indian population in search of education, better work opportunities, and other social commitments, passport has become a necessary document that everyone needs to obtain. Given the ever-increasing demand for passport services and to provide convenience to citizens who previously had to travel long distances to get passports, the Ministry of External Affairs has associated with the Department of Posts to leverage the Post Office network and provide passport services to people in their vicinity by establishing Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSKs). It has been mutually decided by DOP & MEA to open a POPSK in each Lok Sabha constituency. As on 30.11.2025, 452 POPSKs have been operationalized. More than 29 lakh passport applications, including 1.54 lakh Police Clearance Certificates (PCC), and have earned a revenue of Rs. 114.88 crore for the Department for the period from January 2025 to November 2025.

To reach out to the masses in the remotest areas of the country, India Post has also distributed Mobile/Laptop Aadhaar kits to the Post Offices. Because of these Aadhaar Mobile/Laptop kits, Aadhaar Updation/Enrolments can now be done in camp mode, thus helping the masses, especially DBT beneficiaries, to obtain benefits of different government schemes. The Department of Posts, in collaboration with the Army Postal Service (APS) and the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), has started Aadhaar services for Defense personnel. Aadhaar center has been operationalized at Siachin, which marks the highest Aadhaar center in the country.

KVIC Unit Verification by Postal Staff, Bihar Circle 5. KYC (Know Your Customer) Documents Verification/Collection: Memorandum of Understanding (MoUs) have been signed between the Department of Posts and the Unit Trust of India (UTI) on 24.07.2023 and between the Department of Posts and the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI) on 23.04.2024 for the door-to-door collection and verification of KYC documents from mutual fund investors. Around 5 lakh  KYC verifications have been completed as on 30.11.2025. New Initiative: KYC Verification through India Post KYC verification by postmen and other field officials of India Post bridges the gap between the formal financial system and the under covered sections of society fostering economic empowerment and financial inclusion, reducing inequality and contributing to the overall development of the nation. The collaboration between DoP and Mutual Fund companies for KYC (Know Your Customer) verification of their investors is an initiative to streamline and simplify the KYC process for investors. The Department of Posts (DoP) has signed MoU(s) with Nippon India Mutual Fund and SBI Mutual Funds on 03.04.2025 and 29.04.2025 respectively, for the KYC verification of their investors. The Department of Posts (DoP) has also signed a landmark MoU on 17.07.2025 with the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) , to streamline KYC verification for Mutual Fund investors of all 50 Asset Management Companies registered with AMFI. Through this partnership, DoP will utilize its network of 1.64 lakh post offices to assist mutual fund investors in completing and verifying KYC documents, which will help them attain “KYC Validated"" status.  This initiative is a significant step towards ensuring regulatory compliance for legacy investors residing in far corners of the country. It will help investors revive their folios and continue to invest seamlessly in mutual funds. This pathbreaking initiative promotes financial inclusion, particularly in remote and underserved areas, and complies with SEBI regulations to ensure secure and efficient investor servicing. Signing of MoU between Department of Posts and NIPPON India MF on 03.04.2025 Signing of MoU between Department of Posts and SBIMF on 29.04.2025 Signing of MoU between Department of Posts and AMFI on 17.07.2025 New Initiative: Distribution of Mutual Funds through India Post The Department of Posts (DoP) and the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) signed a pioneering MoU on 22.08.2025 , during the 30th Foundation Day Celebration of AMFI in Mumbai. This landmark agreement marks the beginning of a new service model where India Post will act as a distributor to facilitate mutual fund investments through its extensive postal network, particularly benefitting citizens in rural and semi-urban areas. DoP staff will function as mutual fund distributors to enhance mutual fund penetration in smaller towns and rural regions where access to structured financial products has traditionally been limited. India Post has an extensive presence in rural and semi-urban regions across the country, where awareness about mutual fund investments remains relatively low. The initiative aims to broaden access to mutual fund products, leveraging the trust and reach of post offices across the country. Signing of MoU between Department of Posts and AMFI on 22.08.2025 New Initiative: Sale & Recharge of BSNL SIM Cards Signing of MoU between Department of Posts and BSNL on 17.09.2025 The Department of Posts (DoP), under the Ministry of Communications, Government of India, and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on 17.09.2025 , in New Delhi to expand BSNL’s mobile connectivity reach across India. Under this agreement, DoP will leverage its unparalleled postal network of over 1.64 lakh Post Offices for sale of BSNL SIM cards and mobile recharge services across the country. Through this collaboration, post offices will act as Points of Sale (PoS) for BSNL, Mobile SIM sale and for mobile recharges. BSNL will provide SIM stock and training, while DoP will onboard new customers for BSNL and facilitate transactions in a standardized and secure manner. This initiative aims to make BSNL's telecom services more accessible and affordable, particularly for citizens in the remotest parts of the country who often struggle with limited connectivity. By enabling Post Offices as service points, the partnership seeks to bridge the digital divide, empower rural households with mobile services, and advance the broader goals of Digital India, financial inclusion, and socio-economic development. The proof of concept was implemented in Assam, where it has already shown significant success, demonstrating its potential as a scalable model for nationwide rollout. Upcoming Initiatives: 1. Rural Digital Connectivity Survey for Telecom Regulatory Authority & India (TRAI) The upcoming project aims to transform rural connectivity by enabling Dak Sevaks to use a dedicated mobile application to survey the quality and speed of telecom services provided by BSNL, Jio, Airtel, Vodafone, and others across 6.5 lakh villages. Currently under active examination and consideration by both the Department of Posts (DoP) and TRAI, the initiative will help accurately map network gaps and guide improvements in rural telecom infrastructure. This, in turn, is expected to boost communication efficiency, enhance digital banking reliability, and strengthen access to essential online services for rural citizens, while also improving market linkages and economic opportunities. As part of the collaboration framework, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the DoP and TRAI is scheduled to be signed in December 2025 , marking a key milestone in taking this project forward. 2. Onsite MSME Udyam Registration Verification The upcoming project seeks to enhance the authenticity and reliability of the Udyam Registration Portal (URP) by enabling the Department of Posts’ field staff to verify the details of 3.69 crore registered enterprises. Benefits under various government schemes will be released only after verification by DoP, ensuring that subsidies and support reach genuine entrepreneurs. By strengthening the credibility of Udyam data, the initiative is expected to contribute to the creation of over 50 lakh jobs through verified micro-businesses and enable faster access to credit, government schemes, and market opportunities. It will also promote local manufacturing, exports, and broader rural economic growth. The project is under active consideration by the DoP and the Ministry of MSME, with an MoU between the two expected to be signed in December 2025. 3. Udyam Assist Portal Credit Pilot (with SIDBI) The upcoming project focuses on verifying the details of 2.73 crore Informal Micro Enterprises (IMEs) through the Department of Posts’ field staff, ensuring that benefits under the scheme are disbursed only after proper verification by DoP. By authenticating IME data, the initiative aims to support entrepreneurship, enable small businesses to expand, and help them generate sustainable income. It will also strengthen the rural credit ecosystem, drive financial inclusion, and contribute to grassroots-level “Make in India” efforts, ultimately fostering economic empowerment in rural areas. The project is currently under active consideration by the DoP and the Ministry of MSME, with an MoU between the two scheduled to be signed in December 2025 . FS Division e-KYC: Aadhaar-based e-KYC (Electronic Know Your Customer) has been introduced across all Departmental Post Offices pan-India with effect from 06.01.2025 for the onboarding of new customers. e-KYC is a digital method of verifying the identity of customers through electronic records and enables Post Offices to authenticate customers quickly and securely without relying on physical documents. As of November 2025, a total of 1,09,878 accounts have been opened through the e-KYC facility, and 24,45,029 transactions have been carried out. Revamped ATM Network: Department of Posts has undertaken a comprehensive revamp of its ATM network across the country to enhance service delivery and customer convenience. New and upgraded infrastructure is being provided at all 1,000 ATM sites to ensure smooth, secure, and uninterrupted operations. This modernization initiative has significantly improved system reliability and transaction efficiency with faster response times and reduced downtime. The initiative reflects the Department’s commitment to leveraging technology for improved ATM services. DAC Division The Department of Posts, supported by NRSC-ISRO and IIT Hyderabad, designed DIGIPIN, a 10-character alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies every 4 × 4 metre grid across India. Generated from latitude and longitude coordinates, DIGIPIN functions as a permanent, GIS-based digital identifier, converting any location on India’s landmass into a precise, machine-readable address. DIGIPIN was launched on 7 March 2025, and the source code released in the public domain, enabling rapid uptake by both public and private sectors. Further, a web application called “ Know Your DIGIPIN ” was launched on 27 May 2025, to make it convenient for the public to generate their DIGIPIN through their latitude–longitude coordinates and vice versa. By enabling accurate, geocoded and standardised location addressing, DIGIPIN can improve service delivery in various sectors like e-commerce logistics, welfare programme implementation, and emergency response systems, amongst others. At present, it has been integrated with platforms such as ISRO’s BHUVAN, Gram Manchitra, and Rajdharaa, and other central and state level government systems. Special Mention: In December 2025, the initiative received a Special Mention award for Innovation in the Postal Sector at the Asian-Pacific Postal Union (APPU) Business Forum 2025 in Bangkok. International Relations & Global Business Division The 28 th Universal Postal Union (UPU) Congress was held in Dubai from 8th to 19th September 2025. India’s leadership and standing within the global postal community were strongly reaffirmed, with the country being re-elected to both the Council of Administration (CA) and the Postal Operations Council (POC), securing votes among the highest by any member country in our region. A key milestone during the year was the successful launch of the UPI–UPU interlinkage, integrating India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) with the UPU’s Interconnection Platform (IP). India further strengthened its postal diplomacy by enhancing cooperation with Regional Unions through the signing of Letters of Intent (LoI) with Pan African Postal Union (PAPU), the Postal Union of the Americas, Spain and Portugal (PUASP), and the Caribbean Postal Union (CPU), thereby reinforcing engagement with the Global South. These LoIs establish a structured framework for cooperation between the Department of Posts and the respective unions, aimed at strengthening bilateral and multilateral collaboration in the postal sector. Department of Posts also organized the first Asia-Pacific Postal Leaders Forum in Jaipur under the aegis of the Universal Postal Union from 19 th to 21 st March, 2025. The forum provided a platform for deliberations on strengthening postal networks and promoting international collaboration, and was attended by delegates from around 28 countries across the Asia-Pacific region, including the Secretary General of the Asia Pacific Postal Union (APPU). Furthermore, a bilateral International Tracked Packet Service (ITPS) Agreement between India Post and Russian Post was formally signed at DakBhawan on 4 th December 2025. The Agreement establishes the framework governing the exchange, handling, tracking, and delivery of International Tracked Packet consignments between the two postal administrations. Its implementation is expected to strengthen bilateral postal cooperation, enhance service reliability, and facilitate smoother cross-border movement of tracked postal items between India and the Russian Federation. Dak Ghar Niryat Kendra Dak Ghar Niryat Kendra (DNK) is a transformative national initiative of the Department of Posts aimed at democratising exports by enabling small producers, artisans, weavers, women entrepreneurs, self-help groups (SHGs), MSMEs and rural enterprises to directly export in global markets without intermediaries. It is implemented in collaboration with Indian Customs and the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT). DNK has expanded India’s export facilitation infrastructure from 20 Foreign Post Offices (FPOs) to 1,013 dedicated DNKs across 762 districts, including 122 DNKs in the North Eastern Region, thereby bringing export services to the doorsteps of businesses in the hinterland. DNK provides an end-to-end phygital (physical + digital) export enablement ecosystem through a single digital platform. Exporters can complete the entire export lifecycle—one-time registration, KYC, self-booking, label generation, invoice and document upload, faceless customs assessment, digital compliance, Let Export Order (LEO),online payments, shipment tracking and provision to download e-Postal Bill of Export etc. This has eliminated paper-based and time-consuming procedures, reduced transaction time from 2–3 days, lowered costs significantly, improved transparency and enabled real-time interaction between exporters and Customs. The initiative has resulted in complete digitalisation of postal export processes, supported by trained personnel at district-level DNKs who provide continuous handholding to first-time exporters. Seamless integration of DNK with ICEGATE, DGFT, GSTN, Central drugs control organization (CDSCO),  RBI and global postal networks through UPU applications has ensured regulatory compliance and smooth cross-border movement. Exporter-centric features such as dashboards, automated document generation, real-time updates and free API access for aggregators and e-marketplaces further enhance ease of doing business. As of date, DNK has facilitated over 12.31 lakh export shipments with an export value of approximately ₹287 crore, while significantly reducing export costs and delays. DNK is a gender-inclusive and socially impactful initiative, empowering women-led enterprises, SHGs, micro-sellers and rural artisans to participate in global trade. Its contribution to inclusive trade has received international recognition, including the Special Recognition Award at the 1st UPU Trade Post Awards 2023 (Geneva) for promoting women’s participation in exports and a Special Mention for Innovation in the Postal Sector by the Asia-Pacific Postal Union in 2024. Developed in-house, DNK’s scalable digital architecture, continuous capacity building, institutionalised counters and strong multi-agency coordination ensure long-term sustainability, resilience during disruptions and readiness for future expansion, firmly positioning the postal network as a national export facilitation backbone. The Department has organised workshops for marketing executives to create awareness of international mail operations and DNKs. This year National level workshop has been organised at Chennai, Mumbai, Vadodara& Lucknow in 2025. The workshops with exporters are also being organized in colocation with Export Promotion Councils, DGFT, Customs etc. Philately Division Release of Stamps 1.1 Commemorative Postage Stamp Commemorative Postage Stamps on 42 issues were released during the period 1 st January 2025 to 30 th November 2025, commemorating contributions made by various Personalities/ Important Events/ Occasions /Institutions/ Achievements and Joint Issues with friendly nations.

Post Ofﬁce Passport Seva Kendras In view of greater mobility of the Indian population in search of education, better work opportunities, and other social commitments, passport has become a necessary document that everyone needs to obtain. Given the ever-increasing demand for passport services and to provide convenience to citizens who previously had to travel long distances to get passports, the Ministry of External Affairs has associated with the Department of Posts to leverage the Post Office network and provide passport services to people in their vicinity by establishing Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSKs). It has been mutually decided by DOP & MEA to open a POPSK in each Lok Sabha constituency. As on 30.11.2025, 452 POPSKs have been operationalized. More than 29 lakh passport applications, including 1.54 lakh Police Clearance Certificates (PCC), and have earned a revenue of Rs. 114.88 crore for the Department for the period from January 2025 to November 2025.

The facility of these Post Office Aadhaar Centers has brought convenience to citizens in generating new Aadhaar cards and updating their Aadhaar cards in case of any change or mismatch. To reach out to the masses in the remotest areas of the country, India Post has also distributed Mobile/Laptop Aadhaar kits to the Post Offices. Because of these Aadhaar Mobile/Laptop kits, Aadhaar Updation/Enrolments can now be done in camp mode, thus helping the masses, especially DBT beneficiaries, to obtain benefits of different government schemes. The Department of Posts, in collaboration with the Army Postal Service (APS) and the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), has started Aadhaar services for Defense personnel. Aadhaar center has been operationalized at Siachin, which marks the highest Aadhaar center in the country.

KVIC Unit Verification by Postal Staff, Bihar Circle 5. KYC (Know Your Customer) Documents Verification/Collection: Memorandum of Understanding (MoUs) have been signed between the Department of Posts and the Unit Trust of India (UTI) on 24.07.2023 and between the Department of Posts and the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI) on 23.04.2024 for the door-to-door collection and verification of KYC documents from mutual fund investors. Around 5 lakh  KYC verifications have been completed as on 30.11.2025. New Initiative: KYC Verification through India Post KYC verification by postmen and other field officials of India Post bridges the gap between the formal financial system and the under covered sections of society fostering economic empowerment and financial inclusion, reducing inequality and contributing to the overall development of the nation. The collaboration between DoP and Mutual Fund companies for KYC (Know Your Customer) verification of their investors is an initiative to streamline and simplify the KYC process for investors. The Department of Posts (DoP) has signed MoU(s) with Nippon India Mutual Fund and SBI Mutual Funds on 03.04.2025 and 29.04.2025 respectively, for the KYC verification of their investors. The Department of Posts (DoP) has also signed a landmark MoU on 17.07.2025 with the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) , to streamline KYC verification for Mutual Fund investors of all 50 Asset Management Companies registered with AMFI. Through this partnership, DoP will utilize its network of 1.64 lakh post offices to assist mutual fund investors in completing and verifying KYC documents, which will help them attain “KYC Validated"" status.  This initiative is a significant step towards ensuring regulatory compliance for legacy investors residing in far corners of the country. It will help investors revive their folios and continue to invest seamlessly in mutual funds. This pathbreaking initiative promotes financial inclusion, particularly in remote and underserved areas, and complies with SEBI regulations to ensure secure and efficient investor servicing. Signing of MoU between Department of Posts and NIPPON India MF on 03.04.2025 Signing of MoU between Department of Posts and SBIMF on 29.04.2025 Signing of MoU between Department of Posts and AMFI on 17.07.2025 New Initiative: Distribution of Mutual Funds through India Post The Department of Posts (DoP) and the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) signed a pioneering MoU on 22.08.2025 , during the 30th Foundation Day Celebration of AMFI in Mumbai. This landmark agreement marks the beginning of a new service model where India Post will act as a distributor to facilitate mutual fund investments through its extensive postal network, particularly benefitting citizens in rural and semi-urban areas. DoP staff will function as mutual fund distributors to enhance mutual fund penetration in smaller towns and rural regions where access to structured financial products has traditionally been limited. India Post has an extensive presence in rural and semi-urban regions across the country, where awareness about mutual fund investments remains relatively low. The initiative aims to broaden access to mutual fund products, leveraging the trust and reach of post offices across the country. Signing of MoU between Department of Posts and AMFI on 22.08.2025 New Initiative: Sale & Recharge of BSNL SIM Cards Signing of MoU between Department of Posts and BSNL on 17.09.2025 The Department of Posts (DoP), under the Ministry of Communications, Government of India, and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on 17.09.2025 , in New Delhi to expand BSNL’s mobile connectivity reach across India. Under this agreement, DoP will leverage its unparalleled postal network of over 1.64 lakh Post Offices for sale of BSNL SIM cards and mobile recharge services across the country. Through this collaboration, post offices will act as Points of Sale (PoS) for BSNL, Mobile SIM sale and for mobile recharges. BSNL will provide SIM stock and training, while DoP will onboard new customers for BSNL and facilitate transactions in a standardized and secure manner. This initiative aims to make BSNL's telecom services more accessible and affordable, particularly for citizens in the remotest parts of the country who often struggle with limited connectivity. By enabling Post Offices as service points, the partnership seeks to bridge the digital divide, empower rural households with mobile services, and advance the broader goals of Digital India, financial inclusion, and socio-economic development. The proof of concept was implemented in Assam, where it has already shown significant success, demonstrating its potential as a scalable model for nationwide rollout. Upcoming Initiatives: 1. Rural Digital Connectivity Survey for Telecom Regulatory Authority & India (TRAI) The upcoming project aims to transform rural connectivity by enabling Dak Sevaks to use a dedicated mobile application to survey the quality and speed of telecom services provided by BSNL, Jio, Airtel, Vodafone, and others across 6.5 lakh villages. Currently under active examination and consideration by both the Department of Posts (DoP) and TRAI, the initiative will help accurately map network gaps and guide improvements in rural telecom infrastructure. This, in turn, is expected to boost communication efficiency, enhance digital banking reliability, and strengthen access to essential online services for rural citizens, while also improving market linkages and economic opportunities. As part of the collaboration framework, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the DoP and TRAI is scheduled to be signed in December 2025 , marking a key milestone in taking this project forward. 2. Onsite MSME Udyam Registration Verification The upcoming project seeks to enhance the authenticity and reliability of the Udyam Registration Portal (URP) by enabling the Department of Posts’ field staff to verify the details of 3.69 crore registered enterprises. Benefits under various government schemes will be released only after verification by DoP, ensuring that subsidies and support reach genuine entrepreneurs. By strengthening the credibility of Udyam data, the initiative is expected to contribute to the creation of over 50 lakh jobs through verified micro-businesses and enable faster access to credit, government schemes, and market opportunities. It will also promote local manufacturing, exports, and broader rural economic growth. The project is under active consideration by the DoP and the Ministry of MSME, with an MoU between the two expected to be signed in December 2025. 3. Udyam Assist Portal Credit Pilot (with SIDBI) The upcoming project focuses on verifying the details of 2.73 crore Informal Micro Enterprises (IMEs) through the Department of Posts’ field staff, ensuring that benefits under the scheme are disbursed only after proper verification by DoP. By authenticating IME data, the initiative aims to support entrepreneurship, enable small businesses to expand, and help them generate sustainable income. It will also strengthen the rural credit ecosystem, drive financial inclusion, and contribute to grassroots-level “Make in India” efforts, ultimately fostering economic empowerment in rural areas. The project is currently under active consideration by the DoP and the Ministry of MSME, with an MoU between the two scheduled to be signed in December 2025 . FS Division e-KYC: Aadhaar-based e-KYC (Electronic Know Your Customer) has been introduced across all Departmental Post Offices pan-India with effect from 06.01.2025 for the onboarding of new customers. e-KYC is a digital method of verifying the identity of customers through electronic records and enables Post Offices to authenticate customers quickly and securely without relying on physical documents. As of November 2025, a total of 1,09,878 accounts have been opened through the e-KYC facility, and 24,45,029 transactions have been carried out. Revamped ATM Network: Department of Posts has undertaken a comprehensive revamp of its ATM network across the country to enhance service delivery and customer convenience. New and upgraded infrastructure is being provided at all 1,000 ATM sites to ensure smooth, secure, and uninterrupted operations. This modernization initiative has significantly improved system reliability and transaction efficiency with faster response times and reduced downtime. The initiative reflects the Department’s commitment to leveraging technology for improved ATM services. DAC Division The Department of Posts, supported by NRSC-ISRO and IIT Hyderabad, designed DIGIPIN, a 10-character alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies every 4 × 4 metre grid across India. Generated from latitude and longitude coordinates, DIGIPIN functions as a permanent, GIS-based digital identifier, converting any location on India’s landmass into a precise, machine-readable address. DIGIPIN was launched on 7 March 2025, and the source code released in the public domain, enabling rapid uptake by both public and private sectors. Further, a web application called “ Know Your DIGIPIN ” was launched on 27 May 2025, to make it convenient for the public to generate their DIGIPIN through their latitude–longitude coordinates and vice versa. By enabling accurate, geocoded and standardised location addressing, DIGIPIN can improve service delivery in various sectors like e-commerce logistics, welfare programme implementation, and emergency response systems, amongst others. At present, it has been integrated with platforms such as ISRO’s BHUVAN, Gram Manchitra, and Rajdharaa, and other central and state level government systems. Special Mention: In December 2025, the initiative received a Special Mention award for Innovation in the Postal Sector at the Asian-Pacific Postal Union (APPU) Business Forum 2025 in Bangkok. International Relations & Global Business Division The 28 th Universal Postal Union (UPU) Congress was held in Dubai from 8th to 19th September 2025. India’s leadership and standing within the global postal community were strongly reaffirmed, with the country being re-elected to both the Council of Administration (CA) and the Postal Operations Council (POC), securing votes among the highest by any member country in our region. A key milestone during the year was the successful launch of the UPI–UPU interlinkage, integrating India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) with the UPU’s Interconnection Platform (IP). India further strengthened its postal diplomacy by enhancing cooperation with Regional Unions through the signing of Letters of Intent (LoI) with Pan African Postal Union (PAPU), the Postal Union of the Americas, Spain and Portugal (PUASP), and the Caribbean Postal Union (CPU), thereby reinforcing engagement with the Global South. These LoIs establish a structured framework for cooperation between the Department of Posts and the respective unions, aimed at strengthening bilateral and multilateral collaboration in the postal sector. Department of Posts also organized the first Asia-Pacific Postal Leaders Forum in Jaipur under the aegis of the Universal Postal Union from 19 th to 21 st March, 2025. The forum provided a platform for deliberations on strengthening postal networks and promoting international collaboration, and was attended by delegates from around 28 countries across the Asia-Pacific region, including the Secretary General of the Asia Pacific Postal Union (APPU). Furthermore, a bilateral International Tracked Packet Service (ITPS) Agreement between India Post and Russian Post was formally signed at DakBhawan on 4 th December 2025. The Agreement establishes the framework governing the exchange, handling, tracking, and delivery of International Tracked Packet consignments between the two postal administrations. Its implementation is expected to strengthen bilateral postal cooperation, enhance service reliability, and facilitate smoother cross-border movement of tracked postal items between India and the Russian Federation. Dak Ghar Niryat Kendra Dak Ghar Niryat Kendra (DNK) is a transformative national initiative of the Department of Posts aimed at democratising exports by enabling small producers, artisans, weavers, women entrepreneurs, self-help groups (SHGs), MSMEs and rural enterprises to directly export in global markets without intermediaries. It is implemented in collaboration with Indian Customs and the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT). DNK has expanded India’s export facilitation infrastructure from 20 Foreign Post Offices (FPOs) to 1,013 dedicated DNKs across 762 districts, including 122 DNKs in the North Eastern Region, thereby bringing export services to the doorsteps of businesses in the hinterland. DNK provides an end-to-end phygital (physical + digital) export enablement ecosystem through a single digital platform. Exporters can complete the entire export lifecycle—one-time registration, KYC, self-booking, label generation, invoice and document upload, faceless customs assessment, digital compliance, Let Export Order (LEO),online payments, shipment tracking and provision to download e-Postal Bill of Export etc. This has eliminated paper-based and time-consuming procedures, reduced transaction time from 2–3 days, lowered costs significantly, improved transparency and enabled real-time interaction between exporters and Customs. The initiative has resulted in complete digitalisation of postal export processes, supported by trained personnel at district-level DNKs who provide continuous handholding to first-time exporters. Seamless integration of DNK with ICEGATE, DGFT, GSTN, Central drugs control organization (CDSCO),  RBI and global postal networks through UPU applications has ensured regulatory compliance and smooth cross-border movement. Exporter-centric features such as dashboards, automated document generation, real-time updates and free API access for aggregators and e-marketplaces further enhance ease of doing business. As of date, DNK has facilitated over 12.31 lakh export shipments with an export value of approximately ₹287 crore, while significantly reducing export costs and delays. DNK is a gender-inclusive and socially impactful initiative, empowering women-led enterprises, SHGs, micro-sellers and rural artisans to participate in global trade. Its contribution to inclusive trade has received international recognition, including the Special Recognition Award at the 1st UPU Trade Post Awards 2023 (Geneva) for promoting women’s participation in exports and a Special Mention for Innovation in the Postal Sector by the Asia-Pacific Postal Union in 2024. Developed in-house, DNK’s scalable digital architecture, continuous capacity building, institutionalised counters and strong multi-agency coordination ensure long-term sustainability, resilience during disruptions and readiness for future expansion, firmly positioning the postal network as a national export facilitation backbone. The Department has organised workshops for marketing executives to create awareness of international mail operations and DNKs. This year National level workshop has been organised at Chennai, Mumbai, Vadodara& Lucknow in 2025. The workshops with exporters are also being organized in colocation with Export Promotion Councils, DGFT, Customs etc. Philately Division Release of Stamps 1.1 Commemorative Postage Stamp Commemorative Postage Stamps on 42 issues were released during the period 1 st January 2025 to 30 th November 2025, commemorating contributions made by various Personalities/ Important Events/ Occasions /Institutions/ Achievements and Joint Issues with friendly nations.

This period witnessed unprecedented growth in telephone and internet penetration, alongside record-low data costs, powerfully reinforcing India's position as a global digital powerhouse. The rapid expansion of optical fibre and 5G infrastructure, coupled with decisive regulatory reforms under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, marked a pivotal moment for the sector. A central theme of the year was the dramatic strengthening of the telecom ecosystem’s security and accountability, spearheaded by the success of the citizen-centric initiatives like Sanchar Saathi and FRI. In line with the Atmanirbhar Bharat vision, the large-scale rollout of home-grown network infrastructure also gained significant momentum. India became only the 5 th country in the world to have its own 4G stack, upgradable to 5G, demonstrating India’s commitment to technological self-sufficiency. While it took decades to develop such technology in other parts of the world, it took just 2 years to develop such technology. Coupled with this, major strides were achieved in advancing indigenous 6G research and development under the ambitious Bharat 6G Mission . India is emerging as a global leader in telecom—shaping global standards, contributing to international policy dialogues, and positioning itself at the forefront of the next generation of communication technologies. Guided by the vision of ‘Local for Global’ and a commitment to strengthening the startup ecosystem and inclusive growth, the DoT has shaped its digital transformation strategy around the DSS approach— Design in India, Solve in India, Scale for the World. INDIAN TELECOM SCENARIO IN 2025 Telephone Subscriptions: Total telephone connections in India grew from 933 million in March 2014 to 1228.94 million in September, 2025 posting a growth of 31.72%. The number of mobile telephone connections stood at 1182.32 million at the end of September, 2025. The overall tele-density in India was 75.23% in March 2014 which rose to 86.65% in September, 2025.

Internet & Broadband Penetration: Internet connections crossed the milestone of 1 billion to 100.29 crore in June, 2025 compared to 25.15 crore in March, 2014, registering a growth of 298.77%. Broadband connections rose from 6.1 crore in March, 2014 to 99.56 crore in September, 2025 growing by 1532.13%. Average monthly data consumption per wireless data subscriber increased by 399 times to 24.01 GB in June, 2025 from 61.66 MB in March, 2014. The median mobile broadband download speed witnessed a substantial increase, rising from 10.71 Mbps in 2019 to an impressive 131.47 Mbps in October 2025. Similarly, the median fixed broadband download speed increased from 29.25 Mbps in 2019 to 60.34 Mbps in October 2025, according to Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index. Optical Fiber Cable (OFC) length increased from 19.35 lakh route km (2019) to 42.36 lakh route km (as of Sep, 2025). BTS and Towers: The numbers of Mobile Base Transceiver Stations (BTS) are 31.44 lakh as on 31.10.2025. The numbers of mobile towers are 8.43 lakh as on 31.10.2025. Inflow of FDI: FDI (equity flow) in the telecommunication sector during 2024-25 was US $746 million. Data cost: Average cost of 1 GB of mobile data is $0.10 as compared to $0.16 last year. TELECOM REFORMS Telecommunication Act, 2023 The Department is presently in the process of framing of rules under various sections of the Telecom Act, 2023. The Central Government, till date, has enforced 43 sections (out of 62 sections) and notified rules under 14 provisions of the Act. Draft rules under provisions related to authorization, assignment/management of spectrum, regulatory sandbox, etc. are at various stages of drafting/public consultation. Reforms related to Citizens Centric Services and prevention of misuse of Telecom resources for cyber-crime and financial frauds. Sanchar Saathi Portal: The citizen-centric Sanchar Saathi portal ( www.sancharsaathi.gov.in ), launched in 2023 is available in 21 languages and has recorded over 22 crore visits to date. On average, the portal receives around 2.4 lakh visitors per day, and in the current year, the daily visitor count has further increased to approximately 3.7 lakh users. A new module, Trusted Contact Details has been added on Sanchar Saathi portal in 2025. This module has contact details like toll-free numbers, emails, and genuine websites of banks, financial institutions, and government bodies. Sanchar Saathi Mobile App: DoT launched Sanchar Saathi Mobile App on 17.01.2025 in order to provide the convenience of reporting fraudulent calls, blocking/unblocking of lost/stolen mobile handset, knowing mobile connections issued in citizens name etc. The newly launched Sanchar Saathi Mobile App is available for download on both the Google Play Store & Apple App Store and available in Hindi, English & 21 regional languages, ensuring its inclusivity and accessibility nationwide. Sanchar Saathi mobile app has recorded more than 1.5 crore downloads since its launch. Digital Intelligence Platform (DIP): The Digital Intelligence Platform (DIP) was launched in 2024 for sharing of information related to misuse of telecom resources among the stakeholders for prevention of cyber-crime and financial frauds. At present over 850 organizations including Telecom Service Providers (TSPs), MHA, UIDAI, SEBI, FIU, NPCI, Central LEAs, 800+ banks and financial institutions, 35 States/UTs police, central agencies and other stakeholders have on-boarded this platform. This platform, inter-alia, hosts the list of disconnected mobile connections on near real time basis along with the reasons for disconnections enabling the stakeholders to take appropriate action including to disengage the associated services linked with these mobile numbers. Financial Fraud Risk indicator (FRI): In a major step towards combating cybercrime and financial frauds based on pro-active intelligence, the DoT introduced Financial Fraud Risk Indicator (FRI) in May 2025. FRI categorizes mobile numbers based on their potential risk of involvement in financial fraud - medium, high or very high. It allows banks, financial institutions, NBFCs, and UPI service providers to identify threats early and take preventive action like generating alerts, warnings, transaction delays, declines or account restrictions. As reported by stakeholders, Banks/UPI platforms have declined transactions and generated alerts for more than 70 lakh fraudulent transactions, preventing a financial loss of around ₹450 crore for citizens. RBI in collaboration with DoT has issued advisory on integration of the FRI into banking systems to enhance protection and prevention of suspicious transactions. PFDRA issued advisory to Pension Funds & Central Recordkeeping Agencies (CRAs) on adoption of FRI. DoT and Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)-IND have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in September 2025 to strengthen efforts against telecom enabled cyber-crimes and financial frauds. International Incoming Spoofed Calls Prevention System: The system was launched in October 2024 to identify and block incoming international calls spoofed with Indian mobile numbers. It has reduced such malicious call attempts to 1-2 lakh per day as on date. Even these call attempts are blocked at the International Long-Distance gateways itself. Blocking of International Carriers/Aggregators: Analysis of crowd-sourced Chakshu data prompted the blocking of unused area/satellite codes and the blocking of over 309 international carriers/aggregators repeatedly sending spoofed call traffic to India. Based on DoT instructions, major telecom service providers have implemented displaying "" International Call "" to subscribers in all incoming calls with international numbers to India so that citizens can take informed decision and prevented from being victim of cybercrime and financial frauds. Device Setu – Indian Counterfeited Device Restriction (ICDR) system: The system is in place to allow manufacturers, brand owners, and importers to register and generate IMEI certificates free of charge. In 2025, over 48,000 certificates have been issued to local manufacturers and 27,000 to importers, covering ~29.43 crore devices till date. DoT has disconnected approximately 2 lakh Direct Inward Dialing (DID)/landline telephone numbers that were found to be involved in unauthorized promotional activities and illegal activities. In the backdrop of the Indian Telecommunications Act 2023, under Section 22(1) and (2), DoT notified the Telecommunications (Telecom Cyber Security) Rules, 2024 in year 2024. DoT has notified the Telecommunications (Telecom Cyber Security) Amendment Rules, 2025. These Rules aim to safeguard India's communication networks and services. These rules impose stringent obligations on operators from conducting regular security audits to reporting incidents, while prohibiting the tampering of IMEIs. These regulatory measures ensure that both service providers and device importers prioritize cybersecurity and subscriber protection. DoT has partnered with the Railway Protection Force (RPF) to enhance the recovery process of stolen or lost mobile phones in trains through ‘Block your lost / stolen mobile handset’ or Central Equipment Identity Register (CEIR) facility of Sanchar Saathi portal. Summary of Tangible Impact and Outcomes of DoT efforts: (Data till November, 2025) Sr. No. Heading Count 1 Visitors on Sanchar Saathi portal (www.sancharsaathi.gov.in) 22 crore 2 Downloads of Sanchar Saathi mobile app 1.5 crore 3 Mobile number disconnections after re‑verification failures based on ASTR analysis 86 lakh 4 Mobile number disconnections based on inputs of various stakeholders 97.5 lakh 5 Mobile number disconnections for exceeding individual connection limit 1.82 crore 6 Mobile number disconnections based on citizen feedback on Sanchar Saathi (Not My Number/Not Required) 1.94 crore 7 Lost/Stolen mobile handsets traced via CEIR 26.35 lakh 8 Lost/Stolen mobile handsets returned to rightful owners by police 7.3 lakh 9 IMEIs blocked (cyber‑crime/financial‑fraud involvement) 6.21 lakh 10 Point of Sale (SIM sellers) blacklisted 75,410 11 WhatsApp profiles/groups disengaged 28.89 lakh Centralized Right of Way (RoW) Portal One of the salient features of the Telecommunications Act, 2023 is 'Digital by Design': The Act mandates that its implementation shall be digital by design. Accordingly, the Centralized RoW portal was upgraded as per RoW rules, 2024 from 01.01.2025. Later the portal was incorporated into the Unified Portal of DoT named as ‘Telecom eServices Portal’. The portal has streamlined the process of granting permissions for Right of Way applications, reducing the approval time for application processing by ~13x from 448 days (2019) to approx. 34 days (as of Nov, 2025) and ~25% of applications are now being disposed of within 15 days. The portal has successfully streamlined approvals in a time-bound manner leading to a substantial increase in the approval of Towers and Optical Fiber Cable permissions (3.81 lakh applications disposed so far). This acceleration has enabled more mobile connections and improved service quality, effectively bridging the digital divide, especially in rural and remote areas. Implementation of Right of Way (RoW) rules, 2024 across country The Government of India, Department of Telecom has notified the Telecommunications (Right of Way) Rules, 2024 on 17th September, 2024, which came into effect on the 1st day of January, 2025. It, inter-alia, aims to significantly streamline and mitigate several challenges faced in the rollout of telecom infrastructure: Single Window Approval System: Establishment of a unified, single window system for telecom infrastructure approval. This reduces the delays that telecom companies previously faced when obtaining permissions from various local, state, and central authorities. Clear Timelines: The new rules set strict timelines for granting approvals. Uniformity across States and Local Authorities: The rules standardize the process for obtaining RoW permissions across different states and municipalities. This consistency helps telecom companies avoid navigating varying requirements in each region. Facilitating Efficient Use of Public Land/Building: The public entity which is responsible for the infrastructure project or class of infrastructure projects, shall make available such common ducts or conduits or cable corridors for the installation of telecommunication network, on an open access basis, that is, non-discriminatory and non-exclusive, subject to prescribed conditions. Faster Dispute Resolution: The rules introduce a dispute resolution mechanism, allowing telecom companies to resolve conflicts with local authorities or landowners faster than before. Encouraging Shared Infrastructure: The rules also encourage infrastructure sharing between telecom providers, reducing the need for multiple towers or infrastructure in the same area. PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan (NMP) Platform Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has mapped ~13.5 Lakh Route Km of OFC of PSUs, ~43,000 km OFC of state governments, ~8.40 Lakh Telecom towers having ~31.31 lakh (Base Transceivers) BTSs, ~3.15 lakh PM- WANI Wi-Fi hotspots and planned mobile towers from various DBN (Digital Bharat Nidhi) projects on the PM Gati Shakti NMP platform. The mapping of telecom assets has aided in planning new infrastructure projects and rolling out new technologies such as 5G. This comprehensive mapping has enhanced strategic decision-making, optimized resource allocation and accelerate the deployment of telecom infrastructure. Reducing Compliance Burden With the objective of enhancing Ease of Living and Ease of Doing Business, the department has launched an ambitious initiative to reduce compliance burden by simplifying both Government-to-Citizen and Government-to-Business interfaces. In line with this initiative, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) identified 114 compliances for removal or rationalization, of which 110 have already been addressed. Further, following consultations with service providers, the requirements for various periodical reports were reviewed, resulting in the discontinuation of several non-essential reports, increased periodicity for many others, and a transition from physical to digital submissions for multiple compliance requirements. This has significantly streamlined procedures and reduced operational burden on stakeholders. The department has strengthened ease of doing business by extending the validity of Pro Tem Security Certification—from the earlier six months to two years—enabling smoother business continuity for telecom and ICT manufacturers. With 102 certificates already issued, the longer validity will significantly reduce renewal pressures on industry. This move complements DoT’s July 2025 reduction of up to 95% in security testing fees and simplification of processes for Highly Specialized Equipment and End-of-Sale/End-of-Life products, reaffirming the Government’s commitment to supporting domestic and global OEMs under the ComSec scheme, aligned with India’s broader MTCTE-based security certification framework. The DoT has also simplified the security testing and compliance process for Highly Specialized Equipment (HSE) and End-of-Sale/End-of-Life telecom products. These moves signal the government's resolve to enable ease of doing business for both domestic and international Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) in the telecom/ICT sectors. Disaster Management Department of Telecommunications (DoT) continued to strengthen its disaster preparedness and emergency communications framework under SOP-2020, ensuring resilient telecom infrastructure and uninterrupted services during natural disasters and evolving security situations. The Disaster Management (DM) Division coordinated closely with LSAs, Telecom Service Providers (TSPs), and Central and State agencies to ensure rapid restoration of telecom networks and effective communication support for emergency services and citizens. Response and Restoration during Natural Disasters (2025) Himachal Pradesh Floods & Landslides (August 2025): Severe rainfall and landslides in Chamba, Kullu, and Lahaul-Spiti caused major disruptions. DoT enabled immediate ICR activation and Priority Call Routing (PCR). Teams, including those air-dropped in inaccessible regions with State support. Jammu & Kashmir Cloudburst & Landslides (August 2025): Heavy rainfall led to extensive fibre damages and BTS outages across Kishtwar, Doda, Ramban, Reasi, and Udhampur. A 24×7 control room was activated, and ICR remained operational from 26 August to 10 September. With special logistics support and coordination with NDMA, Army, and UT authorities, ~99% connectivity was restored within two weeks. Uttarakhand Cloudbursts – Dharali & Tharali (August 2025): Rapid activation of ICR, deployment of BTSs and small cells, and emergency fibre replacement (with Army support) enabled full restoration within 3–5 days. Punjab Floods (August 2025): Telecom backbone remained intact; BTSs in water-logged pockets were swiftly restored as the situation improved. Cyclone Montha (October 2025): In advance of landfall over coastal Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, DoT activated a 24×7 control room at Vijayawada and issued directions to all TSPs for ensuring uninterrupted network availability, adequate fuel reserves, and deployment of emergency field teams. ICR and Cell Broadcast testing were completed for all TSPs as per SOP-2020, with indigenous Cell Broadcast successfully tested with APSDMA and subsequently utilised for sending early warning alerts. Necessary COWs and mobile BTS units were pre-positioned at vulnerable locations through coordinated planning with State authorities. There was no impact on network during the event and outages of few sites were mainly due to non-availability of power, which got restored immediately on resumption of power supply. Cyclone Ditwah (November 2025): For Cyclone Ditwah, DoT and TN LSA undertook advance preparedness based on IMD warnings by reviewing readiness with all TSPs, ensuring intra-circle roaming, fuel arrangements, identification of response teams, and positioning of critical resources such as mobile DG sets and Cells-on-Wheels; coordination meetings were held with the Tamil Nadu Government, Puducherry Administration and NDMA, network status was monitored twice daily through a dedicated Telecom Control Room, and DoT officers were deployed at the State Emergency Operations Centre—resulting in zero network outages in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry during the cyclone period. Strategic Preparedness & Resilience Measures during Operation Sindoor In May 2025, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) issued a series of comprehensive directives and action plans to strengthen the resilience and continuity of telecom services across the country. The Continuity of Telecom Services Directive emphasized safeguarding networks in border and sensitive districts through adequate fuel stocking, crew mobility facilitation, infrastructure protection, and ICR readiness. Simultaneously, DoT released an Action Plan for Infrastructure Hardening and Cyber-Resilience, outlining measures such as GIS-based risk mapping of telecom assets, enhanced power redundancy, deployment of Quick Response Teams (QRTs), readiness of VSAT and Cell-on-Wheels (COW) systems, and round-the-clock Security Operations Centre (SOC) monitoring. Further, all Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) were mandated to establish National Level Control Centres (NLCCs) for real-time network monitoring and coordinated national response during emergencies. To enhance international connectivity resilience, the Submarine Cable Resilience Programme was implemented, under which all submarine cable operators submitted detailed plans ensuring network redundancy, geographically diverse routes, and readiness of SEAIOCMA repair ships with requisite MoD/MHA clearances. Pan-India Implementation of indigenous Cell Broadcasting for alerts dissemination To strengthen India’s national public warning infrastructure, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the Centre for Development of Telematics (C-DOT) and the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in February 2025 for the implementation of an indigenous Cell Broadcast (CB) system across all Indian telecom networks. The initiative, undertaken under the guidance of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and NDMA, aims to enable the dissemination of location-specific alerts to citizens through mobile networks during natural disasters and emergencies. Following the MoU, C-DOT successfully integrated its indigenously developed CB platform across all four major Telecom Service Providers (Airtel, BSNL, Jio, and Vi), achieving more than 95% pan-India network readiness. During the year, significant milestones were achieved, including pilot testing of the CB system across all TSPs, nationwide integration testing under DoT and NDMA supervision, and live operational deployment during Cyclone Montha (October 2025) in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. The alerts were disseminated in regional languages within 2–3 seconds, reaching affected populations effectively and demonstrating the reliability of India’s indigenous CB technology for mass public alerting. The initiative represents a major step toward achieving the vision of an “Alert for All” system, ensuring rapid and reliable dissemination of disaster warnings across the nation. 5G and 6G Rollout of 5G services 5G services have been rolled out in all States/ UTs across the country and it is available in 99.9% of the districts in the country with a population coverage of 85%. As on 31.10.2025, 5.08 lakh 5G Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) have been installed by the Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) across the country. To accelerate the deployment of 5G services and infrastructure across the country, Government has taken several initiatives, which, inter alia, include the following: Auction of spectrum for 5G mobile services Financial reforms to rationalize Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR), Bank Guarantees (BGs) and interest rates. Removal of Spectrum Usage Charges for spectrum acquired in auction of 2022 and thereafter. Simplification of procedure for SACFA (Standing Advisory Committee on Radio Frequency Allocations) clearance. Launch of GatiShakti Sanchar portal and RoW (Right of Way) Rules to streamline RoW permissions and clearance of installation of telecom infrastructure. Time-bound permission for use of street furniture for installation of small cells and telecommunication line. Implementation of 100 5G Labs Initiative In October 2023, the Hon’ble Prime Minister awarded 100 5G Use Case Labs. All the Labs have been set up, and operationalized since April 2025. A Gradation Framework has been developed to grade the lab’s performance and create a heathy competition among the labs. Top three institutes were felicitated in India Mobile Congress-25. The high performing institutions are being engaged in sharing experience with other institutes to improve their performance. A Competition Framework has been created, in the form 6-month long Hackathon, to create competition among students, faculty, researchers, and startups, and develop solutions for real world problems. This year’s nation-wide Hackathon was conducted from April to September 25. Experts from Industry and ITU were engaged in mentoring the participants. The winners were awarded and facilitated to showcase their products in IMC-25. Industry Leaders in telecommunication [Ericsson & Qualcomm] have been engaged in Capacity Building in Telecommunication. Bharat 6G Vision and Bharat 6G Alliance The Hon’ble Prime Minister launched the Bharat 6G Vision in March 2023, positioning India as a global leader in designing, developing, and deploying 6G technology by 2030. The Bharat 6G Alliance (B6GA) is a collaborative platform bringing together academia, industry, and government to build a comprehensive 6G ecosystem in India. The alliance focuses on research, development, and standardization of 6G technology, with the goal of making India a global leader in the emerging 6G landscape. Bharat 6G Alliance has constituted seven Working Groups on different domains of 6G like Spectrum, Technology, Applications, Green and Sustainability and use cases. In a step towards redefining the future of global communication, the Bharat 6G Alliance signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with leading research alliances for collaborative research and standardization. These MoUs with 6G research alliances will further enable development of secure and trusted telecommunication technology including resilient supply chains. The Government has taken the following initiatives to facilitate the development of 6G technology in the country: Funding two testbeds namely 6G THz Testbed & Advance Optical Communication Testbed to promote R&D and innovation in the country. 100+ research proposals have been approved on 6G network ecosystems to promote research and innovation in line with global roadmap for 6G technology. The Apex Council meeting of the Bharat 6G Mission on 10 th December 2025, chaired by Union Minister Jyotiraditya M. Scindia, highlighted India’s rapid progress toward emerging as a global 6G leader by 2030. The Council reviewed advances in indigenous 6G components, spectrum strategy, international standard-setting, and progress driven by the ₹1-lakh-crore RDI Fund.

Blocking of International Carriers/Aggregators: Analysis of crowd-sourced Chakshu data prompted the blocking of unused area/satellite codes and the blocking of over 309 international carriers/aggregators repeatedly sending spoofed call traffic to India. Based on DoT instructions, major telecom service providers have implemented displaying "" International Call "" to subscribers in all incoming calls with international numbers to India so that citizens can take informed decision and prevented from being victim of cybercrime and financial frauds. Device Setu – Indian Counterfeited Device Restriction (ICDR) system: The system is in place to allow manufacturers, brand owners, and importers to register and generate IMEI certificates free of charge. In 2025, over 48,000 certificates have been issued to local manufacturers and 27,000 to importers, covering ~29.43 crore devices till date. DoT has disconnected approximately 2 lakh Direct Inward Dialing (DID)/landline telephone numbers that were found to be involved in unauthorized promotional activities and illegal activities. In the backdrop of the Indian Telecommunications Act 2023, under Section 22(1) and (2), DoT notified the Telecommunications (Telecom Cyber Security) Rules, 2024 in year 2024. DoT has notified the Telecommunications (Telecom Cyber Security) Amendment Rules, 2025. These Rules aim to safeguard India's communication networks and services. These rules impose stringent obligations on operators from conducting regular security audits to reporting incidents, while prohibiting the tampering of IMEIs. These regulatory measures ensure that both service providers and device importers prioritize cybersecurity and subscriber protection. DoT has partnered with the Railway Protection Force (RPF) to enhance the recovery process of stolen or lost mobile phones in trains through ‘Block your lost / stolen mobile handset’ or Central Equipment Identity Register (CEIR) facility of Sanchar Saathi portal. Summary of Tangible Impact and Outcomes of DoT efforts: (Data till November, 2025) Sr. No. Heading Count 1 Visitors on Sanchar Saathi portal (www.sancharsaathi.gov.in) 22 crore 2 Downloads of Sanchar Saathi mobile app 1.5 crore 3 Mobile number disconnections after re‑verification failures based on ASTR analysis 86 lakh 4 Mobile number disconnections based on inputs of various stakeholders 97.5 lakh 5 Mobile number disconnections for exceeding individual connection limit 1.82 crore 6 Mobile number disconnections based on citizen feedback on Sanchar Saathi (Not My Number/Not Required) 1.94 crore 7 Lost/Stolen mobile handsets traced via CEIR 26.35 lakh 8 Lost/Stolen mobile handsets returned to rightful owners by police 7.3 lakh 9 IMEIs blocked (cyber‑crime/financial‑fraud involvement) 6.21 lakh 10 Point of Sale (SIM sellers) blacklisted 75,410 11 WhatsApp profiles/groups disengaged 28.89 lakh Centralized Right of Way (RoW) Portal One of the salient features of the Telecommunications Act, 2023 is 'Digital by Design': The Act mandates that its implementation shall be digital by design. Accordingly, the Centralized RoW portal was upgraded as per RoW rules, 2024 from 01.01.2025. Later the portal was incorporated into the Unified Portal of DoT named as ‘Telecom eServices Portal’. The portal has streamlined the process of granting permissions for Right of Way applications, reducing the approval time for application processing by ~13x from 448 days (2019) to approx. 34 days (as of Nov, 2025) and ~25% of applications are now being disposed of within 15 days. The portal has successfully streamlined approvals in a time-bound manner leading to a substantial increase in the approval of Towers and Optical Fiber Cable permissions (3.81 lakh applications disposed so far). This acceleration has enabled more mobile connections and improved service quality, effectively bridging the digital divide, especially in rural and remote areas. Implementation of Right of Way (RoW) rules, 2024 across country The Government of India, Department of Telecom has notified the Telecommunications (Right of Way) Rules, 2024 on 17th September, 2024, which came into effect on the 1st day of January, 2025. It, inter-alia, aims to significantly streamline and mitigate several challenges faced in the rollout of telecom infrastructure: Single Window Approval System: Establishment of a unified, single window system for telecom infrastructure approval. This reduces the delays that telecom companies previously faced when obtaining permissions from various local, state, and central authorities. Clear Timelines: The new rules set strict timelines for granting approvals. Uniformity across States and Local Authorities: The rules standardize the process for obtaining RoW permissions across different states and municipalities. This consistency helps telecom companies avoid navigating varying requirements in each region. Facilitating Efficient Use of Public Land/Building: The public entity which is responsible for the infrastructure project or class of infrastructure projects, shall make available such common ducts or conduits or cable corridors for the installation of telecommunication network, on an open access basis, that is, non-discriminatory and non-exclusive, subject to prescribed conditions. Faster Dispute Resolution: The rules introduce a dispute resolution mechanism, allowing telecom companies to resolve conflicts with local authorities or landowners faster than before. Encouraging Shared Infrastructure: The rules also encourage infrastructure sharing between telecom providers, reducing the need for multiple towers or infrastructure in the same area. PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan (NMP) Platform Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has mapped ~13.5 Lakh Route Km of OFC of PSUs, ~43,000 km OFC of state governments, ~8.40 Lakh Telecom towers having ~31.31 lakh (Base Transceivers) BTSs, ~3.15 lakh PM- WANI Wi-Fi hotspots and planned mobile towers from various DBN (Digital Bharat Nidhi) projects on the PM Gati Shakti NMP platform. The mapping of telecom assets has aided in planning new infrastructure projects and rolling out new technologies such as 5G. This comprehensive mapping has enhanced strategic decision-making, optimized resource allocation and accelerate the deployment of telecom infrastructure. Reducing Compliance Burden With the objective of enhancing Ease of Living and Ease of Doing Business, the department has launched an ambitious initiative to reduce compliance burden by simplifying both Government-to-Citizen and Government-to-Business interfaces. In line with this initiative, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) identified 114 compliances for removal or rationalization, of which 110 have already been addressed. Further, following consultations with service providers, the requirements for various periodical reports were reviewed, resulting in the discontinuation of several non-essential reports, increased periodicity for many others, and a transition from physical to digital submissions for multiple compliance requirements. This has significantly streamlined procedures and reduced operational burden on stakeholders. The department has strengthened ease of doing business by extending the validity of Pro Tem Security Certification—from the earlier six months to two years—enabling smoother business continuity for telecom and ICT manufacturers. With 102 certificates already issued, the longer validity will significantly reduce renewal pressures on industry. This move complements DoT’s July 2025 reduction of up to 95% in security testing fees and simplification of processes for Highly Specialized Equipment and End-of-Sale/End-of-Life products, reaffirming the Government’s commitment to supporting domestic and global OEMs under the ComSec scheme, aligned with India’s broader MTCTE-based security certification framework. The DoT has also simplified the security testing and compliance process for Highly Specialized Equipment (HSE) and End-of-Sale/End-of-Life telecom products. These moves signal the government's resolve to enable ease of doing business for both domestic and international Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) in the telecom/ICT sectors. Disaster Management Department of Telecommunications (DoT) continued to strengthen its disaster preparedness and emergency communications framework under SOP-2020, ensuring resilient telecom infrastructure and uninterrupted services during natural disasters and evolving security situations.

ICR and Cell Broadcast testing were completed for all TSPs as per SOP-2020, with indigenous Cell Broadcast successfully tested with APSDMA and subsequently utilised for sending early warning alerts. Necessary COWs and mobile BTS units were pre-positioned at vulnerable locations through coordinated planning with State authorities. There was no impact on network during the event and outages of few sites were mainly due to non-availability of power, which got restored immediately on resumption of power supply. Cyclone Ditwah (November 2025): For Cyclone Ditwah, DoT and TN LSA undertook advance preparedness based on IMD warnings by reviewing readiness with all TSPs, ensuring intra-circle roaming, fuel arrangements, identification of response teams, and positioning of critical resources such as mobile DG sets and Cells-on-Wheels; coordination meetings were held with the Tamil Nadu Government, Puducherry Administration and NDMA, network status was monitored twice daily through a dedicated Telecom Control Room, and DoT officers were deployed at the State Emergency Operations Centre—resulting in zero network outages in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry during the cyclone period. Strategic Preparedness & Resilience Measures during Operation Sindoor In May 2025, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) issued a series of comprehensive directives and action plans to strengthen the resilience and continuity of telecom services across the country. The Continuity of Telecom Services Directive emphasized safeguarding networks in border and sensitive districts through adequate fuel stocking, crew mobility facilitation, infrastructure protection, and ICR readiness. Simultaneously, DoT released an Action Plan for Infrastructure Hardening and Cyber-Resilience, outlining measures such as GIS-based risk mapping of telecom assets, enhanced power redundancy, deployment of Quick Response Teams (QRTs), readiness of VSAT and Cell-on-Wheels (COW) systems, and round-the-clock Security Operations Centre (SOC) monitoring. Further, all Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) were mandated to establish National Level Control Centres (NLCCs) for real-time network monitoring and coordinated national response during emergencies. To enhance international connectivity resilience, the Submarine Cable Resilience Programme was implemented, under which all submarine cable operators submitted detailed plans ensuring network redundancy, geographically diverse routes, and readiness of SEAIOCMA repair ships with requisite MoD/MHA clearances. Pan-India Implementation of indigenous Cell Broadcasting for alerts dissemination To strengthen India’s national public warning infrastructure, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the Centre for Development of Telematics (C-DOT) and the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in February 2025 for the implementation of an indigenous Cell Broadcast (CB) system across all Indian telecom networks. The initiative, undertaken under the guidance of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and NDMA, aims to enable the dissemination of location-specific alerts to citizens through mobile networks during natural disasters and emergencies. Following the MoU, C-DOT successfully integrated its indigenously developed CB platform across all four major Telecom Service Providers (Airtel, BSNL, Jio, and Vi), achieving more than 95% pan-India network readiness. During the year, significant milestones were achieved, including pilot testing of the CB system across all TSPs, nationwide integration testing under DoT and NDMA supervision, and live operational deployment during Cyclone Montha (October 2025) in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. The alerts were disseminated in regional languages within 2–3 seconds, reaching affected populations effectively and demonstrating the reliability of India’s indigenous CB technology for mass public alerting. The initiative represents a major step toward achieving the vision of an “Alert for All” system, ensuring rapid and reliable dissemination of disaster warnings across the nation. 5G and 6G Rollout of 5G services 5G services have been rolled out in all States/ UTs across the country and it is available in 99.9% of the districts in the country with a population coverage of 85%.

                19 DEC 2025 3:02PM by PIB Delhi Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Bhupender Yadav today chaired a high-level meeting to undertake a detailed review of Action Plans of the State Governments of NCT Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, along with concerned Municipal Bodies, for tackling the prevailing adverse air pollution situation in Delhi-NCR. This was the fourth in a series of such review meetings, conducted on a structured set of parameters in the prescribed format, as directed by the Minister in the earlier meeting held on 03.12.2025. Also present in the meeting was the Union Minister of State (EFCC), Shri Kirti Vardhan Singh. Expressing concern over the persistence of poor air quality in the Delhi-NCR, Shri Yadav announced that from January 2026 onwards reviews of action plans, being finalised now, will be held every month at the Ministerial level. State Governments were asked to integrate the action plans of all NCR cities under their jurisdiction for future presentations. The Minister assured that implementation-related bottlenecks would be addressed through regular inter-State coordination meetings at the highest level. Shri Yadav reviewed the individual presentations on measures taken by the State Governments and Municipal Bodies to control air pollution in Delhi-NCR. He emphasised that the momentum of these actions must be sustained until there is a visible improvement in air quality across the NCR. The Minister further made it clear that strict measures must be taken against defaulters, but at the same time the general public must not get inconvenienced unnecessarily. Identified issues are to be addressed through corrective actions, with a review scheduled in 15 days. Directions were issued to ensure smooth traffic management at 62 identified congestion hotspots, and to promote EV/CNG buses for employees by corporates and industrial units in Delhi-NCR. Staggered timings for offices, shopping malls and commercial complexes were also emphasised to reduce peak-hour congestion. Special measures were emphasised to provide end-to-end public transport on high-traffic routes, while strict directions were given to intensify action against illegal and polluting industrial units operating in the region. Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad and Noida were directed to fast-track the implementation of the Integrated Smart Traffic Management System (ITMS), while traffic police were asked to ensure that enforcement checks do not themselves lead to congestion. The Minister underscored coordinated planning with DMRC and State authorities to improve last-mile metro connectivity across NCR cities. Directions were issued to remove encroachments causing traffic congestion within 10 days, ensure annual maintenance contracts for pothole-free roads, and provide proper drainage to prevent monsoon-related damage to the roads. Coordinated redressal of public grievances related to pollution was to be ensured under CAQM’s supervision, along with focused IEC activities for stakeholder engagement. Shri Yadav emphasized on taking necessary steps to ensure visible improvement in the prevailing air quality situation across the NCR within one week. He directed the authorities  to remove dust and construction and demolition (C&D) waste lying on roads, containment of biomass burning, and strict enforcement of construction bans during high pollution periods. Individual officers were asked to be assigned responsibility for Mechanical Road Sweeping Machines (MRSMs), supported by GPS tracking, to ensure efficient road cleaning and dust control. Public representatives were to be involved to strengthen accountability, he desired. The CAQM was advised to issue guidance to Municipal Bodies to not permit demolition activities unless C&D waste collection sub-centres are available within a 10 km radius. C&D activities are to be banned during October–December, and CAQM was asked to explore engagement of start-ups and the private sector for innovative C&D waste management solutions through stakeholder consultations. Haryana was directed to replace defunct Crop Residue Management (CRM) machines, ensure utilisation of paddy straw in power plants, brick kilns and crematoriums, and encourage setting up of pelletisation plants with Central financial assistance. Decentralised and in-situ solutions, including Compressed Bio-Gas ( CBG) and ethanol plants, were to be explored to generate revenue and discourage stubble burning. Specific directions were issued to seal illegal tyre-burning units and other non-permitted polluting establishments operating in Delhi-NCR. Further, it was directed to ensure installation of Online Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems (OCEMS) in all polluting units—particularly in Haryana—and enforce the 31 st December deadline for compliance. The Minister also directed ensuring society-wise solid waste collection and joint disposal of Bandhwari legacy waste by Faridabad and Gurugram at a common facility. In coordination with the Delhi Forest Department, the Minister directed exploration of plantation opportunities in the NDMC area, with a target of planting 11 lakh saplings on the World Environment Day 2026. NHAI was advised to reduce congestion at toll plazas through improved sensors and better Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) systems, and to ensure proper upkeep of major traffic-carrying roads. The meeting was attended by the Secretary (MoEFCC), Chairman, Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), Senior officers from Union Ministries of Environment, Forest and Climate Change; Road Transport and Highways; Heavy Industries and State Governments of NCT Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Also present in the meeting were MD (DMRC), senior officers of MCD, NDMC, Delhi Police, NHAI and DDA, besides Municipal Commissioners and DMs of  Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurugram, Faridabad, along with senior officers from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), respective State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) and Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC). ***** VM (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2206502) आगंतुक पटल  : 18 Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Union Environment Minister Chairs Fourth High-Level Review Meeting on Delhi-NCR Air Pollution; Continuous Monthly Ministerial Reviews of finalised State Action Plans from January 2026 Take Necessary steps to Ensure Visible Improvement in the prevailing Air Quality situation across the NCR within One Week: Shri Yadav प्रविष्टि तिथि:

                19 DEC 2025 12:05PM by PIB Delhi The National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) has continued its succession of Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) disbursements with the release of ₹14.88 crore (USD 1.65 million) to the Andhra Pradesh Forest Department. The funds are earmarked for the protection, conservation, regeneration, research and development, awareness creation, and capacity-building programmes related to Red Sanders, as benefit-sharing contributions arising from 29 Form-I applications. With this release, India’s cumulative ABS disbursements have crossed above ₹143 crore (USD 15.8 million). To date, the NBA has released over ₹104 crore (USD 12.5 million) to the State of Andhra Pradesh towards Red Sanders conservation as well as benefit claimers, and over ₹15 crore (USD 1.8 million) released to various states such as Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha and Telangana. Red Sanders (Pterocarpus santalinus), globally valued for its distinctive deep red timber, is endemic to limited pockets of the Eastern Ghats, notably in the Anantapur, Chittoor, Kadapa, Prakasam and Kurnool districts of Andhra Pradesh. The benefit-sharing contributions have accrued from the auction of 1,115 tonnes of Red Sanders wood confiscated and seized by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and subsequently auctioned by Central Government agencies, including the State Trading Corporation of India Ltd., MMTC Limited and PEC Limited. Noteworthy to mention that through the Red Sanders access and benefit-sharing amount, NBA supported research projects on Red Sanders, covering conservation, sustainable use, genetic improvement, and value addition through reputed government research institutions like ICFRE-IFGTB, ICFRE-IWST, CSIR-IICB. Field surveys across forest divisions of Andhra Pradesh resulted in the documentation of 1,513 genetic resources with geo-referenced traits and assessed over 15,000 standing trees for variability and reproductive behaviour. Seeds from elite resources were collected for ex situ conservation, with ongoing efforts to establish a National Red Sanders Field Gene Bank. Propagation technologies were strengthened through standardised tissue culture, improved germination, and high-success vegetative propagation methods. Preliminary Seed Production Area guidelines were also developed to support long-term sustainability. Value-added products such as soaps, creams, lip care products, and wood coatings were successfully developed from bark and heartwood. Notably, Royalseema RS Soap® was trademarked (Trademark No. 5870030) and Royal Red lipstick met Bureau of Indian Standards specifications, demonstrating translation of research into practical applications by ICFRE – Institute of Forest Genetics and Tree Breeding, Coimbatore. The initiative reaffirms the NBA’s sustained commitment to fair and equitable benefit sharing, prevention of illegal trade, and strengthening of collective action in biodiversity governance.  NBA is ensuring long-term protection of the ecological, genetic, and socio-economic values of Red Sanders by reinvesting ABS proceeds into conservation, scientific innovation, and community-linked development. These efforts collectively safeguard this endemic species for present and future generations while reinforcing India’s leadership in biodiversity governance. **** VM/SK (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2206421) आगंतुक पटल  : 198 इस विज्ञप्ति को इन भाषाओं में पढ़ें: Urdu , हिन्दी Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change NBA Releases ₹14.88 Crore as Access and Benefit Sharing funds to Andhra Pradesh Forest Department Till date, over ₹104 crore disbursed under ABS mechanism for Red Sanders conservation to Andhra Pradesh, taking NBA’s total ABS disbursements beyond ₹143 crores प्रविष्टि तिथि:

                19 DEC 2025 2:50PM by PIB Delhi On the banks of the Kosi River, where for decades people have battled floods, isolation, and long detours, a new dream is taking shape. The 13.3-kilometer Bheja–Bakaur Kosi Bridge is now in its final stage of completion. Once operational, the Kosi River Bridge will reduce travel distance by 44 kilometers, linking the flood-affected, underserved regions of Madhubani and Supaul directly to NH-27 and Patna. It will also open seamless routes to Nepal and the Northeast, boosting cross-border trade, regional commerce, and long-awaited investments. This development falls under the BRT scheme of Bharatmala Pariyojana Phase I in Bihar on EPC mode. With an investment of ₹1101.99 crore, the bridge stands as a significant step toward transforming connectivity in the region. And the project is scheduled to be completed in the Financial Year 2026–2027. Pilgrims will also find easier access to sacred sites like Bhagwati Uchchaith, Bideshwar Dham, Ugratara Temple, and Singheshwar Sthan. Farmers will no longer fear being stranded during floods. Students will reach schools without fear. Traders will deliver goods on time. Small shops will grow; transport services will flourish; local youth will find new jobs. In a region once defined by its struggles against a turbulent river, this bridge is redefining what is possible. And as the final segments of the Kosi bridge rise above the river, the people of North Bihar are united by a single sentiment – their world is about to change forever. Quick Facts: Length of the Project (in Km): 13.300 KM Estimated Civil Project Cost: 1101.99 Cr. Completion Date: Financial Year 2026-2027 For the people of Madhubani, Supaul, Saharsa, and surrounding districts, this bridge is far more than steel and concrete. It is a lifeline, an unbroken chain of hope, easing the journey for communities shaped by the challenges of the Kosi’s floodplain. For Roshan Kumar, a schoolteacher from Saharsa who travels daily to a plus-two school in Madhubani, the bridge represents liberation from years of exhausting journeys. “Right now, to reach Bheja, I travel nearly 70 extra kilometers through Balwaha Pul and the Kosi embankment,” he explains. “Earlier we had to go via Darbhanga or Phulparas, 150 to 200 kilometers of travel. Once the bridge opens, Saharsa to Madhubani will be nearly 70 kilometers shorter. The difference is life-changing.” His voice softens as he adds, “This is not just a bridge. It's time saved, money saved, and energy saved for teachers, students, traders…everyone.” For Pankaj, a medical shop owner in the region, the emotional weight of the project is even deeper. “We have suffered so much,” he says. “Taking patients to hospitals was a nightmare. Floods would cut us off, ferries would stop, and sometimes people lost their lives because help came too late.” Looking at the rising structure, his eyes shine with pride. “Now an ambulance will cross in half an hour. Patients will reach on time. This is dignity. This is safety. We feel proud that such a bridge is being built in our district.” The youth of the region share the same excitement. Neha, an 11th-grade student, recalls how the area suffered during monsoons. “People were scared to cross. The roads would be washed away. But now everything will change. We will reach school safely. Our area will finally feel connected to the rest of the state.” The transformative impact of the bridge extends far beyond these personal journeys. *** GDH/DS (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2206497) आगंतुक पटल  : 36 Ministry of Road Transport & Highways From Flood Fear to Freedom: A New Bridge of Hope Over the Kosi प्रविष्टि तिथि:
