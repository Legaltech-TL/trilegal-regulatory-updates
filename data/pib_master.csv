                17 DEC 2025 3:08PM by PIB Delhi Your Excellency, the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Honourable Speakers of both Houses of Parliament, Honourable Members, Excellencies, and my dear sisters and brothers of Ethiopia, It is a moment of great privilege for me to stand before you today. It is wonderful to be here in Ethiopia, the land of lions. I feel very much at home. Because my home state Gujarat in India, is also home to Lions. I am honoured to be here, in this temple of democracy, in the heart of a nation with ancient wisdom and modern aspirations. And, I come to you with deep respect for your Parliament, your people, and your democratic journey. On behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India, I bring greetings of friendship, goodwill, and brotherhood. I bring greetings of friendship, goodwill, and brotherhood. तेना इस्तील्लीन सलाम Honourable Members, In this great building, your laws are shaped. Here, the will of the people becomes the will of the state. And when the will of the state is in harmony with the will of the people, the wheel of progress moves forward with hope and purpose. Through you, I am also speaking to your farmers in the fields, To the entrepreneurs building new ideas, to the proud women leading communities and institutions, and, to the young people of Ethiopia who are shaping the future. I thank you for this immense privilege. Yesterday, I was also honoured to receive the Grand Honor, Nishan of Ethiopia, from my dear friend Prime Minister Dr. Abiy Ahmed. I accept this award with folded hands, with humility, on behalf of the people of India. आम सग्नालो Honourable Members, Ethiopia is one of the oldest civilisations in human history. Here, history is alive in the mountains, in the valleys, and in the hearts of the Ethiopian people. Today, Ethiopia stands tall because its roots are deep. To stand in Ethiopia is to stand where the past is honoured, the present is full of purpose, and the future is welcomed with open hearts. This blend of old and new... This balance between ancient wisdom and modern ambition... This is the true strength of Ethiopia. This spirit of मेडेमर, or synergy, is very familiar to us in India. Like the monolithic churches of लालिबेला, the ancient rock temples of Tamil Nadu in India are also prayers set in stone. We too are an ancient civilisation, walking confidently into the future. With the call of सबका साथ, सबका विकास, सबका विश्वास, सबका प्रयास। Together, for everyone’s growth, with everyone’s trust and effort. Our emotions for our motherland, also reflect our shared perspectives. India’s national song Vande Mataram, and the Ethiopian national anthem, both refer to our land as the mother. They inspire us to take pride in the heritage, culture, natural beauty and protect the motherland. Honourable Members, Science has traced some of the earliest footprints of our species in Ethiopia. When the world speaks of Lucy, of दिन्किनेश they are not speaking only of a fossil. They are speaking of a beginning. A beginning that belongs to all of us, whether we live in आडिस अबाबा or in Ayodhya. In India, we say Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, the world is one family. It reminds us that beyond politics, beyond borders, beyond differences, we share a common origin. And if our beginning was shared, then our destiny must also be shared. Honourable Members, India and Ethiopia share warmth in climate, as well as in spirit. Nearly two thousand years ago, our ancestors built connections across great waters. Across the Indian Ocean, merchants sailed with spices, cotton, coffee, and gold. But, they traded more than goods. They exchanged ideas, stories, and ways of life. Ports like अदूलिस and Dholera were not just trade centres. They were bridges between civilisations. In modern times, our relationship entered a new era. Indian soldiers fought alongside Ethiopians for the liberation of Ethiopia in 1941. Our formal diplomatic relations began soon after India became independent. But even before embassies were set up, our people had already started writing a new chapter together. Thousands of Indian teachers came to Ethiopia. They taught children in आडिस अबाबा, in दिरे दावा, from बाहिर दार to मेकेले. They reached Ethiopian schools, and entered Ethiopian hearts. Even today, many Ethiopian parents speak warmly about Indian teachers who shaped the future of their children. And just as Indian teachers came here, Ethiopian students also travelled to India, seeking knowledge and friendship. They went to India as students and returned home as the builders of modern Ethiopia. I am told that some of them are present here in this Parliament right now! Including the Honourable Speaker तागेसे चाफो. They have also played a special role in building our people-to-people ties. Because they introduced Ethiopian cuisine in India. In India, we also enjoy eating ""श्री अन्न” millets like Ragi and Bajra. So, the flavour of Ethiopian टेफ is very comforting for us. And, since we enjoy eating the Indian Thali, the Ethiopian बेया-नैतू also feels very familiar to us. Honourable Members, Today, Indian companies are among the largest foreign investors in Ethiopia. They have invested more than five billion dollars in diverse sectors like textiles, manufacturing, agriculture, health, and more. And, they have created more than seventy-five thousand local jobs. But, I am sure we can all agree, our partnership has a lot more potential. That is why, Prime Minister Dr. Abiy Ahmed and I took a big step forward yesterday. We have decided to elevate our bilateral relationship to the level of a Strategic Partnership. This will unleash the potential of our economies, through cooperation in technology, innovation, mining, sustainability, and clean energy. It will also help secure the future for our peoples through cooperation in food security, health security and capacity building. In addition, we will also enhance our trade and investment cooperation, as well as on defence and security matters. Honourable Members, As developing countries, we have a lot to learn from and offer to each other. Agriculture forms the backbone of our two nations. It feeds our people. It sustains our farmers. It connects tradition with innovation. We can work together to develop better seeds, irrigation systems and soil-health technologies. As climate change affects rainfall and crop cycles, we can share knowledge in climate-resilient farming. From dairy farming to farm mechanisation, from millet research to food processing, together, we can help our farmers prosper. Honourable Members, In India, we have built a robust Digital Public Infrastructure. It has transformed the way we deliver services and how people access them. Today, every citizen in India can use technology for payments, for identity, and for government services. More than half of the world’s real-time digital payments now happen in India. Welfare benefits worth over 500 billion dollars have reached hundreds of millions of beneficiaries directly in their bank accounts, without leakages or corruption. Three times every year, nearly 100 million farmers receive financial assistance at the click of a button. As you roll out the Digital Ethiopia 2025 Strategy, we are ready to share our expertise and our experience with Ethiopia. And, we are honoured that you have picked India as the trusted partner to develop the Data Centre for your Foreign Ministry. Honourable Members, India is known as the pharmacy of the world. During the Covid pandemic, the entire world was worried. It was a very difficult time. Despite limited resources, we considered it our sacred duty to humanity to do everything possible to help others. India sent medicines and vaccines to more than 150 countries. It was India’s proud privilege to supply Ethiopia with over 4 million vaccine doses. And, our good fortune to do so in partnership with the W.H.O led by डॉक्टर टेडरोस, a proud son of Ethiopia, known in India as तुलसी भाई. I am glad that our healthcare cooperation is growing, from pharmaceuticals to hospitals, and from traditional medicine to telemedicine. We are committed to strengthen our health security cooperation further - from provisioning of new equipment in hospitals, to capacity building of healthcare professionals. Honourable Members, Ethiopia sits at a crossroads of Africa. India stands at the heart of the Indian Ocean. We are natural partners in regional peace, security, and connectivity. Our commitment to mutual security became stronger with the signing of the Defence Cooperation Agreement earlier this year. This agreement focuses on closer military cooperation. It includes collaboration in cybersecurity, in defence industries, in joint research, and in capacity building. I take this opportunity to thank Ethiopia for your solidarity after the terrorist attack in India in Pahalgam in April. I also thank you for receiving our All Party Parliamentary Delegation so warmly, and for affirming the commitment of Zero Tolerance towards terrorism. Honourable Members, As vibrant and diverse democracies, we both understand that democracy is a way of life, and it is a journey. It is shaped sometimes by debate, sometimes by disagreement, but always by belief in the rule of law and the will of the people. Both our constitutions also reflect this spirit. India’s Constitution begins with the words: ""We, the People of India.” Ethiopia’s Constitution begins with: ""We, the Nations, Nationalities and Peoples of Ethiopia.” Their message is the same: our destiny is in our hands. This morning, I had the honor to lay a wreath at the आड्वा Victory Monument. This monument is a timeless reminder of how Ethiopia’s victory inspired the entire colonised world in its quest for dignity and freedom. And in these times of conflict and uncertainty, it is a reminder that the people of the Global South can stand up for themselves. Honourable Members, Mahatma Gandhi gave us the concept of trusteeship. We do not own this beautiful planet and its resources. Instead, we are trustees who must take care of them and pass them to our children. The spirit of trusteeship that guides India’s ""एक पेड़ माँ के नाम” - ""A Tree for Mother” initiative - is also reflected in Ethiopia’s Green Legacy Initiative. Both our nations believe in caring for Mother Earth. Both believe in giving back to nature. Together, let us work on renewable energy and green jobs. Let us work on disaster resilient infrastructure and bio-fuels. And let us raise a strong voice for climate justice. India will be happy to support Ethiopia’s efforts to give a powerful voice to the Global South at COP-32 in 2027. Honourable Members, I am told that there is a saying in Ethiopia, ""When spider webs unite, they can tie up a lion.” We too believe in India, that मन मिलें तो पर्वत भी रास्ता दे देते हैं - when hearts are united, even mountains give way. Indeed, solidarity is strength, and cooperation is power. And today, as nations of the Global South, as ancient civilisations, as friends, India and Ethiopia are standing together. We stand together as members of one family. And we work for a world that is more just, more equal, and more peaceful. It was here, in आडिस अबाबा, that the dreams of African unity found a home. I am told that many streets of this wonderful city are even named after African countries! On the other side of the Indian Ocean, it was in New Delhi, that India was honoured to welcome the African Union as a permanent member of the G20. Last year, we marked another historic step with the inclusion of Ethiopia as a full member of the BRICS. In fact, over the 11 years of my government, the connection between India and Africa has grown manifold. During this period, we have exchanged more than 100 visits at the level of Heads of State and Government. Honourable Members, The Global South is writing its own destiny. And, India and Ethiopia share a vision for it. Our vision is of a world where the Global South rises not against anyone, but for everyone. A world where development is fair, where technology is accessible, and where sovereignty is respected. A world where prosperity is shared, and peace is defended. And, a world where decision-making reflects today’s reality, not the world of 1945. Because the world cannot move forward if its systems remain locked in the past. That is why, India has emphasized a Global Development Compact. It will prioritize technology sharing, affordable finance, capacity building, and trade for sustainable growth. That is why, at the G-20 Summit in November, I called for an ""Africa Skills Multiplier Initiative”, to train one million trainers. It will build local capacities, and help your efforts towards inclusive and sustainable development. Honourable Members, My personal association with tea is well-known. But, it is impossible to come to Ethiopia and not mention coffee! It is one of your greatest gifts to the world! In an Ethiopian coffee ceremony, people sit together, time slows down, and friendships deepen. In India too, a cup of tea is an invitation to talk, to share, to connect. And, just like Ethiopian coffee and Indian tea, our friendship is brewing stronger! Today, I stand before you, among sisters and brothers, with a deep sense of gratitude, and bright hopes for the future. The future is calling. And, India and Ethiopia are ready to answer. Honourable Members, As I conclude, I give you my word, that we will walk together as equals. We will build together as partners. And, we will succeed together as friends. Thank you for the honour of addressing this Parliament. Thank you for your friendship. Thank you for your trust. तब्बारकु देना हुन्नु आम सग्नालो Thank you. *** MJPS/ST (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205184) आगंतुक पटल  : 199 इस विज्ञप्ति को इन भाषाओं में पढ़ें: Gujarati Prime Minister's Office Text of Prime Minister’s address at Joint session of Parliament of Ethiopia प्रविष्टि तिथि:

                17 DEC 2025 4:45PM by PIB Delhi During the last 5 years (December 2020 to December 2025), 22 ISRO satellites have been launched. Out of which 7 are Earth Observation, 4 are communication, 2 are navigation, 3 are space science and 6 are technology demonstration missions. The details of the launches are attached in Annexure-1. There has been no cost overrun in Chandrayaan-3 and Aditya-L1 satellite projects. However, there has been time overrun of 28 and 46 months respectively for Chandrayaan-3 and Aditya-L1 satellites, mainly due to the following reasons: Aditya-L1: Time overrun in the project is due to change in the scope, change in orbit from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to Lagrangian Point (L1) calling for changes in the satellite configuration, longer cycle for the payload development and procurement of long lead items. Chandrayaan-3: Time overrun is due to reconfiguration of systems to incorporate suggested by Chandrayaan-2 Failure Analysis Committee, COVID-19 Pandemic, Conduct of New Special Test and New Sensor development. Gaganyaan Programme aims to demonstrate indigenous human spaceflight capability to Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The programme was officially sanctioned by the Government of India in January 2019 with a mandate to undertake two uncrewed missions in identical configuration and one crewed mission with total budget approval of ₹9,023 Crore with target schedule of crewed mission launch in May 2022. Recently in October 2024, the scope of Gaganyaan programme was revised from three to eight mission including additional uncrewed mission (G1) and also four precursor missions for Bharatiya Antariksh Station (BAS) with total revised budget provision of ₹20,193Crore. The activities as per revised approval is in progress with target of first Crewed mission in year 2027-28. For the Gaganyaan programme, ISRO is developing and realising various systems for accomplishing the planned missions. Considering the stringent human rating requirements, extensive testing of propulsion elements, structures of Human-Rated Launch Vehicle (HLVM3), Service Module Propulsion System and Crew Module Propulsion System, parachute-based deceleration system has been completed. The critical Crew Escape System motors have also been developed and static tests have been completed. In parallel, development of indigenous Environmental Control and Life Support Systems is in progress. Major infrastructure such as the Orbital Module Preparation Facility, Gaganyaan Control Centre, Crew training facility have been established. Second launch pad modifications have been incorporated. Precursor missions such as TV-D1 and IADT-01 have been successfully accomplished. Ground tracking networks, terrestrial links and IDRSS-1 feeder stations have been established. Crew Module Recovery plan as well as assets to be deployed have been finalized. For the first uncrewed mission (G1), all HLVM3 stages and CES motors are ready. Crew and Service Module systems have been realized. Assembly and integration activities are nearing completion. The first crewed mission is targeted in 2027-28. India has achieved self-reliance in space transportation systems to launch satellites up to 10 tons to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and 4.2 tons to Geo-Synchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) through the currently operational PSLV, GSLV and LVM3 launch vehicles. These launch vehicles have enabled independent space access to satellites for earth observation, communication, navigation and space exploration. In order to enhance the launch vehicle capabilities towards meeting the expanded space vision, Government has approved the development of a Next Generation Launch Vehicle (NGLV) which will provide a maximum payload capability of 30 tons to Low Earth Orbit. Towards achieving low-cost access to space, reusable launch vehicle technologies are also being developed including a partially reusable variant of NGLV with 14 tons payload capability to LEO. Another development is of a winged body upper stage which will fly back from the orbit to the Earth and autonomously land on a runway. With regard to development of more powerful and more efficient propulsion systems, ISRO has undertaken the development of a high-thrust (2000kN) semi-cryogenic engine for inducting in the LVM3 vehicle. An environmentally friendly Methane based propulsion system for high-thrust engine is also being conceptualized for the Next Generation Launch Vehicle, ensuring technology readiness for the launch vehicle for the proposed Crewed Moon Mission. Apart from these, development of an air-breathing propulsion system is underway towards a Dual-Fuel Scramjet engine. The Government proposes to increase budget allocation for critical space infrastructure and R&D projects of the Department of Space. The Space Vision 2047 of the Government targets establishment of the Bharatiya Antariksh Station by 2035 and landing of an Indian on Moon by 2040. Towards this, Government has approved five key R&D intensive projects: the Gaganyaan follow-on mission; the Chandrayaan follow-on missions including Chandrayaan-4 Lunar Sample Return Mission and the Chandrayaan-5/LUPEX mission; the Venus Orbiter Mission; and the development of the Next Generation Launch Vehicle. As part of the expansion of ground infrastructure for achieving the Space Vision, Government has approved two more launch pads – one at Kulasekarapattinam in Tamil Nadu and a Third Launch Pad for the next generation of Launch Vehicles. **** NKR/AK Annexure-1 List of satellites launched during last 5 years Sl.

With a view to optimally utilise limited uranium reserves and large thorium reserves in the country, the Department of Atomic Energy has adopted a three-stage nuclear power programme, based on a closed nuclear fuel cycle, for generation of nuclear power and for achieving long term energy security. The three-stage nuclear power programme, which is to be implemented sequentially, aims to multiply the domestically available fissile resources through the use of natural Uranium in Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (first stage), followed by use of Plutonium obtained from the spent fuel of Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors in Fast Breeder Reactors, in the second stage. Large scale use of Thorium will subsequently follow making use of Uranium- 233 that will be bred in Fast Breeder Reactors, when adequate nuclear installed capacity in the country has been built.  Accordingly, the utilisation of Thorium as a practically inexhaustible energy source has been contemplated during the third stage of the Indian nuclear programme, which can be reached in future. The first stage of nuclear power programme comprising indigenous Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) is in industrial domain.

                17 DEC 2025 2:00PM by PIB Delhi Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) a Constituent Unit of Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) by using radiation induced mutagenesis along with cross breeding, has developed 72 improved crop varieties in oilseeds (groundnut, mustard, soybean and sunflower), pulses (urdbean, mungbean, pigeonpea and cowpea), rice, jute and banana, which have been released and notified for commercial cultivation. These crop varieties have desirable traits such as high yield, early maturity, resistant to lodging, biotic & abiotic stress tolerance etc. and thus benefiting farmers in the country. In the last five (5) years (i.e. from 2020-2025), by employing radiation-induced mutagenesis, DAE has developed and released a total of 23 varieties for cultivation by farmers. These include (a) 7 rice varieties, (b) 5 mustard varieties, (c) 3 black gram (urad) varieties, (d) 3 sorghum (jowar) varieties, (e) 2 groundnut varieties, (f) one mung bean variety, (g) one sesamum (til) variety and (h) one banana variety. In the last five (5) years, a total 1680 quintals of breeder seeds of Trombay crop varieties, including groundnut, mungbean, rice and mustard varieties, were produced for distribution to seed corporations/companies and farmers for multiplication for cultivation by farmers. The estimated quantity of seeds available to farmers for cultivation is around 18,05,300 quintals. These estimates are based on the expected multiplication ratios observed during production of foundation seeds from breeder seeds and subsequently, certified seeds from foundation seeds. Radiation-based food-preservation technologies involving irradiation, and subsequent cold storage, developed by BARC are being employed for extending the shelf life of perishable agriculture produce, mitigate post-harvest and storage losses of agriculture produce. Irradiation of grains and spices eliminates insects and microbes and is a useful method of chemical free preservation. The technology is being deployed to facilitate; Export of agriculture produce such as mangoes, pomegranates to countries like United States of America (USA), Australia etc., through sea route in an economical manner. Shelf-life extension of spices, grains, vegetables, fruits, onions and potatoes. Shelf-life extension processed food products. Forty-one (41) food irradiation and medical product sterilization facilities have already been commissioned in private/State Government sectors in the country and they are providing radiation processing services on demand basis. DAE has been involved in the use of radiations and radioisotopes in agriculture through continuous R&D programmes. In field of nuclear agriculture, development and field trials of radiation induced improved crops are implemented in collaboration with various State Agricultural Universities, as well as research institutes under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). BARC developed radiation technologies not only extend shelf life and prevent post harvesting losses, but also helps India meet international quarantine requirements for perishable commodities, enabling access to high-value markets. India has been exporting mangoes and pomegranate to the USA, Australia, South Africa and Malaysia using irradiation as a mandatory phytosanitary treatment. These measures strengthen export-oriented value chains and boost incomes of farmers and traders. BARC is involved in developing comprehensive Standard Operating Protocols (SOPs) for the irradiation of agricultural produce to achieve shelf-life extension, reduction of post-harvest losses, and improvement in marketability. Overall, the Government's initiatives, including R&D collaborations, establishment of irradiation infrastructure, and promotion of export-oriented radiation processing, are helping to strengthen national food security, reduce wastage, improve farmer incomes, and enhance India’s competitiveness in global agri-trade. **** NKR/AK (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205121) आगंतुक पटल  : 105 इस विज्ञप्ति को इन भाषाओं में पढ़ें: Urdu Department of Atomic Energy PARLIAMENT QUESTION: NUCLEAR SCIENCE FOR AGRICULTURE AND FOOD PRESERVATION प्रविष्टि तिथि:

                17 DEC 2025 5:13PM by PIB Delhi The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) issued a Direction on 16 th December, 2025 mandating that the entities regulated by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) should adopt ‘1600’ series numbers by the last date of 15 th February, 2026 for making service and transactional calls to the consumers. The Direction has been issued with the objective of enhancing consumer trust, curbing spam, and preventing fraudulent activities perpetrated through voice calls. The mandate for last date has been issued in consultation with IRDAI. Earlier TRAI had issued similar Directions for mandatory adoptions of 1600 series numbers by entities regulated by RBI, SEBI and PFRDA. In response to TRAI’s regulatory initiative, the ‘1600’ numbering series has been assigned by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) for allocation to entities in the Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) sector, and Government organizations to clearly distinguish their service and transactional calls from other commercial communications. The series will enable citizens to reliably identify legitimate calls originating from regulated financial entities. After the assignment of the series and allocation of numbering resources to the Telecom Service Providers (TSPs), TRAI has regularly engaged with TSPs and the BFSI sector regulators for adoption of 1600 series by BFSI sector entities. Consequent to these efforts, about 570 entities have already adopted 1600 series numbers, subscribing to a total of over 3000 numbers. Based on TRAI’s interactions with stakeholders, it was considered that time is now ripe to mandate timebound completion of the exercise so that entities continuing to use standard 10-digit numbers for service and transactional calls, also shift to 1600 series numbers to reduce the risk of fraudulent or misleading calls being made in the guise of trusted financial institutions. TRAI has taken input regarding timelines from the IRDAI, following deliberations held during the meetings of the Joint Committee of Regulators (JCoR). Based on the consultations held with them, an implementation schedule has now been issued. The structured and time-bound adoption of the 1600-series will significantly improve consumer safety and help curb impersonation-based financial frauds perpetrated through voice calls. **** MI/ARJ (Release ID: 2205350) Visitor Counter : 4 Ministry of Communications TRAI issues Direction mandating adoption of 1600-series by entities regulated by IRDAI Posted On:

PACS are developed as hubs for delivering benefits from schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana(PMFBY), Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samriddhi Kendra (PMKSK), interest subvention, fertiliser and seed distribution, PDS outlets, LPG/Petrol/Diesel dealerships, custom hiring, PM Jan Aushadhi Kendras, Common Service Centres, etc.. and Integration with the state specific portal like, Bhulekh portal (In U.P and M.P), e-KYC and e-Uparjan (M.P), e-Crop, CCRC (Andra Pradesh) and other schemes of other States and also with the Cooperative Banking systems. Various steps taken to convert PACS into multi-service centres for farmers in Bihar, are as under: Under State Plan in Bihar, 7,221 Godowns have been constructed in PACS throughout the state creating storage capacity of 17.14 Lakh MT, thereby fortifying the physical infrastructure. 278 Godowns carrying storage capacity of 2.49 lakh MT have been sanctioned during present FY 2025-26. Further, 36 PACS with capacity of 1,33,500 MT have been identified by Cooperative Department, Govt. of Bihar under the World’s Largest Grain Storage Plan (WLGSP). 5256 PACS are functioning as Common Service Centres providing services on banking education, Digi Pay, IRCTC, Electricity bill, KVK crop health care etc. 12 PACS have applied for petrol/diesel retail outlets in CC2/open category, and 05 PACS have been selected by Oil Marketing Companies. Out of 412 applications received from PACS as PM Jan Aushadhi Kendras, drug license has been issued to 30 PACS and currently 21 Jan Aushadhi Kendra are operational in PACS. 2271 PACS have fertilizer license, out of which 1681 PACS have been upgraded as PM Kisan Samriddhi Kendras. These Kendras provides additional services such as soil testing, training etc. Under Financial Inclusion Fund, NABARD and Bihar State Cooperative Bank have sanctioned an amount of Rs. 1.76 cr for 785 micro-ATMs during FY 2024-25 and Rs.53.77 lakh for 239 micro-ATMs in FY 2025-26. Further, Rs. 22.11 lakh has been sanctioned for conducting 390 Financial Literacy Awareness Programmes (FLAPs) to DCCBs for organizing FLAPs for dissemination of financial literacy to rural population including farmers. During FY 2025-26, 130 FLAPs with grant assistance of Rs. 7.53 lakh have been sanctioned to DCCBs for conducting financial literacy under FIF (Financial Inclusion Fund). As per National Cooperative Database (NCD), out of 7,398 PACS working as Custom Hiring Centres in country, 2,661 centres are working in Bihar. Training and capacity-building programmes implemented through the National Council for Cooperative Training (NCCT) and its network of RICMs and ICMs aimed at strengthening governance, transparency, and member engagement in cooperative institutions. These programmes have resulted in demonstrable improvements in operational efficiency and professional competence across several States. Since the inception of the Ministry of Cooperation, NCCT institutes have trained 9,82,787 participants through 15,919 training programmes. With respect to the State of Bihar, RICM Patna, under NCCT, has trained 43,290 participants across various training programmes, covering a wide range of cooperative sectors. NCCT provided training programme for the secretaries of on boarded PACS in CSC Portal for providing 300 online services to the PACS members. Under this, 57 programmes were conducted in Bihar and 2096 PACS secretaries were trained in 2024-25. Through this training several PACS reported measurable benefits, enhanced service delivery, increased footfall, and improved inclusion of youth and women. Government subsidies provided through schemes such as Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF), Agriculture Marketing Infrastructure (AMI), Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM) for creating warehouses, custom hiring centers, primary processing units and other agri-infrastructure for grain storage at PACS level will reduce wastage of food grains and transportation costs, enable farmers to realize better prices for their produce and meet various agricultural needs at the PACS level itself. Further, NCDC has been providing financial assistance to the cooperative sector under its Corporation - sponsored schemes, covering a wide range of notified commodities and services, as amended from time to time. In recent years, NCDC has introduced sector-specific schemes and focused products to align with the evolving needs of the cooperative sector, with special emphasis on women empowerment, digitization of cooperatives, and rural healthcare. The combined impact of training and subsidies has resulted in improved transparency, better service delivery, and higher participation of members in cooperative activities The Ministry of Cooperation, since its inception has undertaken several important initiatives to improve the financial condition of cooperative societies, enhance their efficiency, and ensure transparency in their functioning, with the vision of “Sahakar se Samriddhi”. Despite substantial progress, cooperatives continue to face challenges such as limited professional management capacity, inadequate access to affordable credit, financial constraints in undertaking infrastructure projects, and the need to improve market linkages. To address these issues, the National Cooperation Policy (NCP) 2025 outlines a ten-year roadmap focused on accessible finance, multi-sector expansion, and technology-driven transparency. Financial stability is being further reinforced through measures such as reducing the surcharge for cooperatives with income between ₹1 crore and ₹10 crore from 12% to 7%, lowering the Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) from 18.5% to 15%, and introducing a concessional 15% tax rate for new manufacturing cooperatives established before March 31, 2024. For Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS) and Primary Cooperative Agriculture and Rural Development Banks (PCARDBs), the permissible limits for cash deposits, payments, loans and loan repayments have been enhanced from ₹20,000 to ₹2 lakh per member, easing their operational flexibility. Significant financial support has been extended for infrastructure development, including a total outlay of ₹2,925.39 crore for the computerisation of functional PACS. Under the Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure (AMI) Scheme, margin money requirements for PACS godowns have been reduced from 20% to 10%, subsidy rates have been increased from 25% to 33.33%, and an additional subsidy equal to one-third of the total admissible subsidy is provided for ancillary facilities such as internal roads and weighbridges. The Ministry has also facilitated the disbursal of ₹190 crore to Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) and ₹98 crore to Fish Farmer Producer Organisations (FFPOs) through National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC). Financial stability is being further reinforced through a ₹2,000 crore Government grant to NCDC, enabling mobilisation of ₹20,000 crore for cooperative lending, along with a new ₹24,000 crore NCDC scheme for 29,050 cooperative societies. Banking reforms, including allowing cooperative banks to adopt one-time settlements, CGTMSE-based collateral-free lending, and the creation of Sahakar Sarathi for providing shared technological services, are improving financial resilience. Efforts to diversify cooperative revenue streams through national multi-state cooperative federations such as BBSSL, NCOL and NCEL, and the establishment of the Tribhuvan Sahkari University (TSU) for professionalising cooperative leadership, are further strengthening the long-term financial stability and governance of cooperatives across the country. These measures aim to improve financial stability, enhance transparency, diversify revenue streams, and ensure long-term sustainability of cooperatives, including those in Bihar.

                        17 DEC 2025 1:11PM by PIB Delhi In order to realise the vision of ‘Sahakar Se Samriddhi’, the Ministry has taken various initiatives for development of Cooperative Sector. One such initiative is approval of the plan to establish new multipurpose PACS/dairy/fisheries cooperatives, aiming to cover all panchayats and villages in the country over the next five years, including the State of Odisha. As of November 15, 2025, a total of 30,083 new PACS, Dairy and Fishery Cooperative Societies have been registered; and 15,793 Dairy and Fisheries Cooperative Societies have been strengthened; 255,881 Gram Panchayats (GPs) are covered by PACS; 87,159 Gram Panchayats are covered by dairy cooperative societies; and 29,964 Gram Panchayats are covered by fisheries cooperative societies. In the State of Odisha total 2,039 new M-PACS (1537), Dairy (451) and Fisheries (51) Cooperative Societies have been registered and 209 Dairy Cooperative Societies are Strengthened. Under the Centrally Sponsored Project for the computerisation of functional PACS, Odisha has been sanctioned 4,240 PACS to be brought onto an ERP-based common national software aimed at improving transparency and operational efficiency. Women and tribal cooperatives in Odisha additionally benefit from national interest subvention schemes of NCDC. During the last three years, financial assistance, grants and credit facilities extended under national programmes have also been made available to the State of Odisha. NCDC has provided a total of ₹10.74 crore for cooperative development in the State, comprising ₹1.61 crore in 2022–23, ₹3.24 crore in 2023–24 and ₹5.89 crore in 2024–25 (Disbursement by NCDC during last 5 years is Attached at Annexure-I). Targeted support to women and tribal cooperatives has likewise been extended, with ₹0.20 crore disbursed over this period. This includes ₹35 lakh to the Self-Employment Mahila Cooperative Organisation Ltd., ₹31.80 lakh to Maa Sureswari Farmer Producer Cooperative Society Ltd., ₹2.50 lakh to Swaviman Primary Fisheries Cooperative Society (100% ST members) and ₹9.30 lakh to Gajapati Organic Farmer Producer Cooperative Society Ltd. (100% ST members). Additionally, ₹18.07 crore has been released as Central share to Odisha during FY 2025–26 under the PACS Computerisation Project. For training and capacity building of about 4106 PACS functionaries, assistance of ₹1.24 crore has been provided to the two Cooperative Training Institutes (CTIs) of Odisha i.e. Agriculture Cooperative Staff Training Institute (ACSTI) and Madhusudan Institute of Cooperative Management (MICM) for 135 training programmes for PACS. As on 15.11.2025, Odisha has 7,595 cooperative societies and 94,92,273 members across all districts. District-wise Cooperative Societies and Membership details in Odisha are attached as Annexure-II. Several measures being implemented nationwide, including in Odisha, aimed to strengthen the cooperative structure, promote agriculture-based entrepreneurship and reinforce the rural economy. These include continued implementation of the national plan to establish two lakh new multipurpose PACS, Dairy and Fishery Cooperatives to ensure cooperative presence in all uncovered Panchayats and villages. The rollout of the World’s Largest Decentralised Grain Storage Plan will convert PACS into infrastructure and service hubs with godowns, custom hiring centres and primary processing units, improving farmers’ post-harvest outcomes. Digital modernisation efforts across the sanctioned PACS in Odisha will continue under the PACS Computerisation Project, enhancing transparency and operational efficiency. Adoption of Model Bye-laws is being encouraged so that PACS can diversify into more than 25 economic activities such as PMKSKs, CSCs and PMBJKs. Significant financial support has been extended for infrastructure development, including a total outlay of ₹2,925.39 crore for the computerisation of functional PACS. Under the Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure (AMI) Scheme, margin money requirements for PACS godowns have been reduced from 20% to 10%, subsidy rates have been increased from 25% to 33.33%, and an additional subsidy equal to one-third of the total admissible subsidy is provided for ancillary facilities such as internal roads and weighbridges. The Ministry has also facilitated the disbursal of ₹190 crore to Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) and ₹98 crore to Fish Farmer Producer Organisations (FFPOs) through National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC). The establishment of national multi-state cooperative institutions—NCOL, NCEL and BBSSL—will further support market access, branding, procurement and value-chain participation for primary producers and the establishment of the Tribhuvan Sahkari University (TSU) for professionalising cooperative leadership, are further strengthening the long-term financial stability and governance of cooperatives across the country, including Odisha. *** Annexure-I Last 5 Years Activity wise Disbursement in Odisha (Rs.in crore) S.

To ensure a stable and adequate supply of qualified and trained manpower, the “Tribhuvan” Sahkari University is mandated to create a pan-India network of cooperative institutions by opening new schools at the University campus and other States and affiliating existing cooperative institutes/colleges based on a set of criteria to maintain quality standards. Further, the National Cooperation Policy 2025, which was launched by the Ministry on 24th July 2025, also contains the plan of the Central Government to involve national/state-level cooperative societies and universities in shaping the cooperative industry, some of which have been reproduced as under: 3.3.2. Encourage sectoral national federations to develop a repository of success stories on prevailing best practices in the cooperative sector to promote the spirit of cooperation and their emulation. Promote strengthening the upper tiers of the cooperatives to take on larger responsibilities in supporting their primary members to become more competitive. Encourage the national-level federations/unions to play leading roles in revitalizing the cooperative sector by helping member cooperatives to develop and adopt best practices for transparency and good governance, and deepening the cooperative movement through cooperative advocacy, awareness and member education.

                17 DEC 2025 5:04PM by PIB Delhi As per the updated seismic zonation map of India, the entire Himalayan arc falls within the highest seismic risk category, Seismic Zone VI, reflecting its extremely high tectonic activity and vulnerability to strong earthquakes. Only a small portion of the Ladakh region in the north-eastern corner falls under Seismic Zone V, which is the second-highest seismic hazard category. In view of the high-risk seismic categorisation of the Himalayan region, the Government has undertaken several focused initiatives to strengthen earthquake monitoring, hazard assessment, and preparedness. These measures include the expansion and upgradation of the seismic monitoring network across Himalayas, the conduct of detailed regional seismic hazard assessments, enhancement of strong-motion instrumentation, and improvement of data acquisition systems to enable precise detection and analysis of seismic events. In addition, various scientific studies relating to site response, fault mapping, and regional source characterisation have been carried out to support disaster risk reduction efforts and facilitate informed planning and development in the Himalayan region. Seismic Microzonation studies conducted by NCS for selected cities, help to identify differential ground-shaking characteristics at the local level, thereby assisting in safe land-use planning, infrastructure design, and mitigation strategies. The National Centre for Seismology (NCS) is making steady and systematic progress toward establishing an operational Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) system in India. A real-time seismic network dedicated to EEW has been initiated across the Himalayan region, including the installation of 10 P-Alert instruments in the Himachal Himalayas for rapid ground-motion detection.

                17 DEC 2025 5:02PM by PIB Delhi The accuracy of the forecasting models used by IMD has improved significantly; however, it is not possible to forecast with 100% accuracy. The skill score for 24-hour (1 day) in advance detection of monsoonal heavy rainfall over the meteorological subdivisions is 85% in 2024. At present, the accuracy of IMD's heavy rainfall forecasts, measured as the percentage of correct warnings, is 85%, 73%, 67%, 63%, and 58% for lead times ranging from one to five days, respectively. Overall, forecast accuracy for heavy rainfall events across the country improved by about 40% in 2023–2024 compared to 2014. IMD issues heavy rainfall impact-based forecasting and risk-based early warnings considering the amount of heavy rainfall and the susceptibility of the area of occurrence of heavy rainfall. The warning is issued at the meteorological subdivision and district level, valid up to 7 and 5 days, respectively. There is also nowcasting every three hours, with validity of the next three hours for heavy rainfall. IMD's state-of-the-art forecasting system is fully operational in all the districts of the country. The high-resolution models and GIS systems cover all the districts of the country. Regarding the Doppler Weather Radar (DWR) Network, currently, 47 DWRs are in operation across India, with 87% of the total area of the country coming under radar coverage . In the coming years, DWRs will be installed as per the requirement to cover the remaining gap areas in the country, provide redundancy, and replacement of old radars in the DWR network under Mission Mausam of MoES. The Ministry is continuously working to strengthen observational capabilities and R&D infrastructure to achieve greater accuracy in weather forecasting. Further, the IMD has expanded its infrastructure for observations, data exchange, monitoring & analysis, forecasting, and warning services in the country, including vulnerable districts. To provide computational support for such high-resolution models and to enable them to run regularly in real-time, the computing facilities (Arunika and Arka) have also been substantially increased to integrate voluminous data and run mesoscale, regional, and global models at higher resolutions. Further, recently, a new Central Sector Scheme, ""Mission Mausam"", was launched by the MoES to make Bharat a ""weather-ready and climate-smart"" nation. Various steps have been taken to ensure effective dissemination of warnings to vulnerable populations. The recently launched Bharat Forecasting System (BharatFS) has been developed primarily to improve short- and medium-range weather predictions. Forecast improvement is a continuous process with augmentation of more observations and Numerical Weather Prediction Models. With further improvement in  the observational network consisting of traditional (surface, AWS/ARG/HWSR, and upper air stations-RS/RW, GPS Sonde, Pilot balloon, and wind profilers) and remote-sensing observing platforms (Satellites and Radars), the forecast accuracy is likely to improve further. All warnings originated by IMD pertaining to Monsoon are made available to SDMAs in near real time for further dissemination over SMS, Mobile App, Sachet Public Portal, GAGAN & NaVIC Satellite terminals, and RSS feed. There is no processing delay in the Sachet platform. Central Water Commission (CWC) developed the FloodWatch India mobile application during the 2023 monsoon season to provide real-time flood information, forecasts, and alerts to users across the country. The FloodWatch India App, developed and maintained by the CWC, provides near real-time information and presently disseminates flood forecasting information (water levels) for 200 flood forecasting stations across the country, near real-time water levels for an additional 500+flood monitoring stations, and live storage status of 150+major reservoirs, thereby enabling continuous situational awareness for various stakeholders. The application serves as a vital decision-support tool for Disaster Management Authorities at the Central, State, District, and Local levels, besides being accessible to the general public. Timely availability of river flow conditions, flood forecasts, and reservoir storage data strengthens preparedness, early warning, and coordinated response during flood situations. Since its launch, CWC has been continuously sensitizing and engaging stakeholders through various platforms such as workshops, trainings, review meetings, and conferences to promote wider adoption of the application. CWC takes immense steps and adopts various dissemination mechanisms to ensure maximum reach of the flood warnings produced, so that mitigation measures can be adopted by State Governments, State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), and the Public. The total number of downloads till date from the Android (Google Play Store) is 35.1k, while from the iOS (Apple App Store) is 2.58k. For wider outreach, the app is prominently displayed on the CWC's official website and showcased in national exhibitions, including the most recent World Trade Fair. The flood forecasts formulated by CWC are disseminated to all stakeholders through the Flood Forecasting Website, FloodWatch India 2.0 App, e-mail, WhatsApp, Facebook (CWCOfficial.FF), X (Twitter CWCOfficial_FF), and the 'CWC Flood Updates' YouTube channel. Yes. The IMD provides threshold-based, impact-based forecasts and risk-based early warnings, which are colour-coded, to all the districts of the country. A suitable colour code is used to highlight the impact of the severe weather expected and signal disaster management about the course of action to be taken regarding an impending severe weather event. IMD's Impact-Based Forecasting (IBF) provides localized risk assessments for vulnerable populations in advance of extreme events. CWC monitors the floods in three categories with assigned colors, namely Above Normal-Yellow(River water level between Warning level & Danger level), Severe-Orange(River water level between danger level & Highest Flood Level), and Extreme-Red (River Water Level above Highest Flood Level). As per the Ministry of Home Affairs Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), Above Normal flood situation is updated on daily basis, Severe Flood is updated on 6 hourly basis and Extreme Flood is updated on 3 hourly basis. Sachet is disseminating alerts, which are colour-coded. SDMAs are converting the forecast/warnings received from five Warnings & Forecast generating Agencies (AGAs)- India Meteorological Department (IMD), Central Water Commission (CWC), Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), Defence Geoinformatics Research Establishment (DGRE), and Forest Survey of India (FSI) into impact-based alerts before dissemination on the Sachet platform. Yes, since inception, Sachet disseminates alerts to all States & UTs, and till now approximately 89 thousand alerts have been generated on the SACHET Platform, and 11000 Crore SMSs have been sent to the citizens. At present, there are nearly 13.98 lakh Mobile App Users and 31.57 thousand Browser Notification users in the country. NDMA regularly undertakes targeted campaigns to inform, educate, and raise public awareness about various hazards and disaster management initiatives, including the SACHET App/Portal. Awareness about the SACHET App/Portal is being disseminated consistently through electronic and print media, specialized field-based outreach activities such as awareness van campaigns, Nukkad Natak, focused social media campaigns, proactive sharing of the QR code across digital and print events, including Maha Kumbh 2025 and the India International Trade Fair (IITF). ***** NKR/AK (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205323) आगंतुक पटल  : 8 Ministry of Earth Sciences PARLIAMENT QUESTION: MONSOON WARNING SYSTEM प्रविष्टि तिथि:

For wider outreach, the app is prominently displayed on the CWC's official website and showcased in national exhibitions, including the most recent World Trade Fair. The flood forecasts formulated by CWC are disseminated to all stakeholders through the Flood Forecasting Website, FloodWatch India 2.0 App, e-mail, WhatsApp, Facebook (CWCOfficial.FF), X (Twitter CWCOfficial_FF), and the 'CWC Flood Updates' YouTube channel. Yes. The IMD provides threshold-based, impact-based forecasts and risk-based early warnings, which are colour-coded, to all the districts of the country. A suitable colour code is used to highlight the impact of the severe weather expected and signal disaster management about the course of action to be taken regarding an impending severe weather event. IMD's Impact-Based Forecasting (IBF) provides localized risk assessments for vulnerable populations in advance of extreme events. CWC monitors the floods in three categories with assigned colors, namely Above Normal-Yellow(River water level between Warning level & Danger level), Severe-Orange(River water level between danger level & Highest Flood Level), and Extreme-Red (River Water Level above Highest Flood Level). As per the Ministry of Home Affairs Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), Above Normal flood situation is updated on daily basis, Severe Flood is updated on 6 hourly basis and Extreme Flood is updated on 3 hourly basis. Sachet is disseminating alerts, which are colour-coded. SDMAs are converting the forecast/warnings received from five Warnings & Forecast generating Agencies (AGAs)- India Meteorological Department (IMD), Central Water Commission (CWC), Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), Defence Geoinformatics Research Establishment (DGRE), and Forest Survey of India (FSI) into impact-based alerts before dissemination on the Sachet platform. Yes, since inception, Sachet disseminates alerts to all States & UTs, and till now approximately 89 thousand alerts have been generated on the SACHET Platform, and 11000 Crore SMSs have been sent to the citizens. At present, there are nearly 13.98 lakh Mobile App Users and 31.57 thousand Browser Notification users in the country. NDMA regularly undertakes targeted campaigns to inform, educate, and raise public awareness about various hazards and disaster management initiatives, including the SACHET App/Portal. Awareness about the SACHET App/Portal is being disseminated consistently through electronic and print media, specialized field-based outreach activities such as awareness van campaigns, Nukkad Natak, focused social media campaigns, proactive sharing of the QR code across digital and print events, including Maha Kumbh 2025 and the India International Trade Fair (IITF). ***** NKR/AK (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205323)","2025-12-17T11:51:16.732215"

                17 DEC 2025 5:00PM by PIB Delhi The current forecasting models used by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) are highly accurate. In 2024, the skill score for 24-hour (one-day) advance detection of heavy rainfall over meteorological subdivisions stands at 85%. At present, the accuracy of IMD's heavy rainfall forecasts, measured as the percentage of correct warnings, is 85%, 73%, 67%, 63% and 58% for lead times ranging from one to five days, respectively. Overall, forecast accuracy for heavy rainfall events across the country improved by about 40% in 2023–2024 compared to 2014. The Geological Survey of India (GSI), under the Ministry of Mines, has been mandated to issue regional landslide forecasts/early warnings based on rainfall thresholds. Currently, GSI issues operational/experimental daily regional landslide forecast bulletins to 21 districts in 08 (eight) States during the monsoon period. GSI's landslide forecast model is primarily based on rainfall thresholds derived from historical rainfall and landslide occurrence data, in conjunction with daily rainfall forecast data received from institutions under the Ministry of Earth Sciences. Regarding the efficiency of this current forecast model, the evaluation shows a hit rate of more than 80% across the forecasting zones of operational districts, viz, Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Nilgiris and Rudraprayag. Improving the accuracy of weather forecasts requires enhanced state-of-the-art observational networks, skilled human resources to undertake research and development for the development of numerical weather prediction models, and robust infrastructure, such as high-performance computing systems to run these models at the required high resolution to predict weather patterns caused by climate change. The Ministry is in continuous endeavour of augmenting the observational and R&D infrastructure towards achieving better accuracy in weather forecasting. The major new initiative undertaken by the Government is the implementation of the Mission Mausam. A couple of Doppler Weather Radars (DWRs) have already been installed under the mission. Currently, 47 radars are in operation across India, with 87% of the country's total area under radar coverage. Under the Mission Mausam, the Bharat Forecast System (BharatFS), an advanced weather forecasting model, has been developed and is operational at a high spatial resolution of 6-km. It also has the capability to provide predictions of rainfall events up to 10 days, covering the short and medium-range forecasts. Due to its higher resolution and improved dynamics, it generates weather forecasts at the panchayat or cluster of panchayats level. Further, a major achievement is the introduction of the Mithuna Forecast System (Mithuna-FS). This new-generation global coupled model integrates the atmosphere, ocean, land surface, and sea ice components with state-of-the-art physics and an upgraded data assimilation framework. Currently, this forecasting system operates at 12-km resolution, marking a significant advancement in India's medium-range localized weather forecasting capability. The Mithuna-FS suite also includes – A 4-km high-resolution regional model for accurate simulation of monsoon dynamics, cyclones, and mesoscale extreme events over the Indian subcontinent; A 330-m hyper-resolution urban model for fog, visibility, and air-quality forecasting over the Delhi region. IMD consistently issues timely alerts and forecasts to the public and concerned stakeholders. Various steps have been taken to ensure effective dissemination of warnings to vulnerable populations. IMD's weather information, including alerts  and warnings to the public, is provided through various platforms: Mass Media: Radio/TV, Newspaper network (AM, FM, Community Radio, Private TV), Prasar Bharati, and private broadcasters.

Moreover, IMD developed a mobile App, 'MAUSAM' for weather forecasting, 'Meghdoot' for Agromet advisory dissemination, and 'Damini' for lightning alerts. The Common Alert Protocol (CAP), developed by the NDMA, is also being implemented to disseminate warnings by the IMD. IMD currently is equipped with a Decision Support System (DSS) based real-time multi-hazard impact based early warning system (EWS), which integrates all types of real-time and historical data, numerical weather prediction products, etc., to effectively monitor, detect and provide timely forecasts and impact-based warnings with suggested actions up to districts and city/station levels against all types of extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall events, droughts etc. IMD has Meteorological Centres (MCs) in each State and also special centers like Cyclone Warning Centers available for each impacted State, which provide services during cyclones and heavy rainfall seasons round the clock, respectively. As a result of these new initiatives, the overall skill of forecasting these severe weather events has been improved by 30-40% over the last 10 years. ***** NKR/AK (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205318) आगंतुक पटल  : 8 Ministry of Earth Sciences PARLIAMENT QUESTION: FORECASTING OF HEAVY RAINS AND LANDSLIDES प्रविष्टि तिथि:

                17 DEC 2025 4:58PM by PIB Delhi The Government has taken due note of the climate change across the country. The Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), Government of India, through its Climate Change report titled ""Assessment of Climate Change over the Indian Region (https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-15-4327-2)"" has assessed the impact of climate change across the country. Since the middle of the twentieth century, India has witnessed a rise in average temperature; a decrease in monsoon precipitation; a rise in extreme temperature and rainfall events, droughts, and a rise in sea levels; and an increase in the intensity of severe cyclones. The soil degradation and groundwater depletion is emerging as one of the most serious environmental and socio-economic challenges. The Government has undertaken multiple initiatives to advance Earth science research, capacity building, and educational infrastructure across the country. Dedicated institutes under the MoES e.g., Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), India Meteorological Department (IMD), National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF), Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR), National Centre for Seismology (NCS), National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR), National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), Centre for Marine Living Resources & Ecology (CMLRE), National Center for Earth System Sciences (NCESS) are advancing research in the interactions between the atmosphere, oceans, and polar systems, focusing on their role in regional climate dynamics and extreme weather patterns. IITM lead the flagship capacity‑building initiative under MoES, the Development of Skilled Manpower in Earth System Sciences (DESK) program, with the objective to develop academic habit through training on targeted areas and semester-based coursework in Earth Sciences. Efforts are also being made to strengthen the scientific community's capacity in climate science and assessment through training programs, workshops, and knowledge exchanges, ensuring that India has the necessary expertise to understand and respond to the complex climate challenges. The Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) has developed advanced early warning systems for severe weather events such as cyclones, heavy rainfall, droughts, and other extreme conditions. Early warning for severe weather events is supported by a state-of-the-art observation network that includes surface, upper air, remote sensing observations, seamless forecasting systems based on high-resolution dynamical models, and GIS-based tools for generating alerts and warnings. The entire system is integrated with modern telecommunication technologies to ensure the timely and effective dissemination of information. Recently, the India Meteorological Department (IMD), in coordination with other centres in the MoES, has developed an end-to-end GIS-based Decision Support System (DSS), which has been working as the front end of the early warning systems for the timely detection and monitoring of all-weather hazards across the country, including the States regularly affected by cyclones and other natural disasters. It is supported with specific severe weather modules to provide timely impact-based early warnings for extreme weather events like cyclones, heavy rainfall, droughts, etc., which devastate human lives, livelihoods, and infrastructure. The system utilizes historical data, including extreme events, as well as real-time surface and upper-air meteorological observations available for the Indian region and its neighbouring areas. It also includes RADAR observations, available every 10 minutes, and satellite products every 15 minutes. It also uses numerical weather prediction products from a suite of models run in the MoES institutions. These include hyperlocal, regional, and global models. Further, IMD plays a crucial role in safeguarding lives and property through its advanced observational network and forecasting systems, enabling timely preparedness and response in close collaboration with the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). This coordinated approach ensures that accurate and timely weather information reaches authorities and the public, enhancing disaster risk reduction efforts across the country. The Central Water Commission (CWC) is mandated to issue short-range flood forecasts with a lead time of up to 24 hours to concerned State Governments at identified locations. Timely flood forecasts are being issued when a certain threshold limit is reached. The CWC has taken several steps by adopting various dissemination mechanisms to get maximum reach to the flood warnings, so that mitigation measures can be adopted by State Governments, SDMA, NDMA, and the public. Further, w ith an aim of disseminating information related to the flood situation in the country and flood forecasts up to 7 days on a real-time basis to the public through mobile phones, version 2.0 of the 'FloodWatch India' mobile application has been developed by the CWC, which provides current information on flood conditions across the country. Further, it also provides additional information regarding the storage positions of 150 major reservoirs in the country, which helps in a better understanding of the possible flood situation in their downstream areas. The 'FloodWatch India' app is available for download. The Geological Survey of India (GSI) is mandated to conduct landslide studies in landslide-prone areas in the country. In July 2024, with the inauguration of the National Landslide Forecasting Centre (NLFC) at Kolkata, GSI achieved a milestone by operationalizing landslide forecasting in three districts in two States, viz. Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts of West Bengal and the Nilgiris district of Tamil Nadu. At present, RLFS covers 21 districts (04 operational and 17 experimental) in eight states (West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Nagaland, Karnataka, and Kerala). These bulletins forecast information on the possibility of occurrence of landslides up to the taluk / sub-divisional level daily for the next 48 hours. IMD has adopted new techniques and technology from time to time to detect, monitor, and provide timely early warnings for the entire country, including the States regularly affected by all types of extreme weather events like cyclones , heavy rainfall, droughts, etc., which have devastating impacts on human lives, livelihoods, and infrastructure. There has been significant progress in this direction with: Strengthening of the observing system with installation of additional AWS, ARG, and DWR, etc. Improvement of the data integration and development of GIS-based DSS. Improvement of NWP models and climate models, as well as a real-time seamless monitoring, forecasting, and early warning system. Shifting from conventional weather forecast and warning to sector-specific color-coded Impact-based forecast (IBF) and risk-based warning (RBW) up to district/sub-city levels with dynamical impact and risk matrix. Application of AI/ML. Customisation of bulletins and warnings. Substantial increase of computational power to integrate voluminous data and to run meso-scale, regional, and global models at a further higher resolution scale with improvement of process understanding and model physics. Supercomputers (Arka and Arunika) are being used for this purpose. Panchayat Mausam Seva. A state-of-the-art dissemination system with the use of a mobile app, Common Alerting Protocol (CAP), WhatsApp groups, etc. IMD developed a mobile App, 'MAUSAM' for weather forecasting, 'Meghdoot' for Agromet advisory dissemination, and 'Damini' for lightning alerts. IMD has also brought out a web-based online ""Climate Hazard & Vulnerability Atlas of India"" prepared for the thirteen most hazardous meteorological events, which cause extensive damage and economic, human, and animal losses. The same can be accessed at https://imdpune.gov.in/hazardatlas/abouthazard.html. This atlas will help State Government authorities and disaster management agencies identify the hotspots and plan and take appropriate action to tackle extreme weather events. This product helps build Climate Change resilient infrastructure. The Government of India has recently launched Mission Mausam, a national initiative, under the Ministry of Earth Sciences with a goal of making Bharat a ""Weather-ready and Climate-smart"" nation to mitigate the impact of climate change and extreme weather events and strengthen the resilience of communities. Under Mission Mausam, initiatives are undergoing to develop a hybrid Earth System Modeling framework (dynamical model with AI based parameterisation) for weather predictions and  climate projections. In addition, India has augmented its HPC power by commissioning state-of-the-art High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems 'Arka' (at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune) and 'Arunika' (at the National Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting, Noida) for Earth System Modeling. Enhancing the HPC facilities and Earth System Modeling capabilities are planned under Mission Mausam. Various initiatives were undertaken to foster enhanced collaboration among national research institutions within India. Major national missions, such as the Mission Mausam, Monsoon Mission, and Deep Ocean Mission, are designed to enhance collaboration across various national institutes like IITM, IMD, ISRO, NCMRWF, INCOIS, NIOT, and national research institutions and universities. Joint research initiatives integrate satellite data from ISRO with forecasting systems of IMD and research inputs from academic institutions. India is actively collaborating with international programs like the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), the World Weather Research Program, etc., on weather and climate research and to develop and improve weather and climate models. These models aim to simulate and predict the interactions between the atmosphere, ocean, and polar regions, crucial for understanding regional extremes and climate impacts. These collective actions contribute to a more robust understanding of Earth System interactions, which is essential for enhancing India's resilience to extreme weather and climate change impacts. ***** NKR/AK (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205313) आगंतुक पटल  : 9 Ministry of Earth Sciences PARLIAMENT QUESTION: RISING THREATS OF CLIMATE CHANGE प्रविष्टि तिथि:

The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) was mandated by the UNGA in 2001 to harness the potential of knowledge and technology to support development for all and to ensure that their benefits reach all people and countries. The WSIS process was conducted in two phases- Geneva (2003) and Tunis (2005). Later the progress in implementing WSIS outcomes reviewed by UNGA during the WSIS +10 Review Process in 2015. The WSIS+20 Review in 2025, conducts a comprehensive review by taking stock of the achievements, key trends, progress and challenges over two decades since the inception of WSIS and outlines priority areas for focus. Speaking on the occasion, Shri Prasada conveyed  that over the past two decades, WSIS has demonstrated how digital technologies, when guided by shared values, can advance development, inclusion and human dignity. He further recalled Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s emphasis that “ global challenges demand that global action must match global ambition ”. Delivering the statement, Shri Prasada highlighted that India’s digital transformation has been a lived experience at population scale, driven by Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) built as a public good - open, interoperable, secure and affordable by design. He added that platforms enabling digital identity, instant payments, digital documentation, telemedicine, online education and grievance redressal today serve people across diverse geographies, languages and income levels, ensuring that technology empowers the last mile and the last person. Shri Prasada further recalled India’s launch of the Global Digital Public Infrastructure Repository during its G20 Presidency, reflecting the principle that digital public goods can act as an equaliser rather than a divider. He reaffirmed India’s commitment to sharing capacity, tools and knowledge with partner countries, guided by the ethos of “One Earth, One Family, One Future.” On emerging technologies, Shri Prasada noted that Artificial Intelligence is central to the next phase of sustainable development. Through the IndiaAI Mission, India is investing in responsible AI ecosystems, expanding national compute capacity, creating repositories of reusable datasets through AI Kosh, and building Bhashini, an AI and NLP-enabled real-time translation tool, to make the content available in various languages spoken in our country. He added that India has also proposed the creation of a Global Repository of AI Applications to accelerate AI for social good. Emphasising the importance of resilient semiconductor and electronics supply chains being foundational to digital transformation and AI at scale, Shri Prasada outlined the ongoing efforts made to strengthen domestic capabilities while deepening international partnerships to enhance global technology resilience. Reaffirming strong support for the multistakeholder model of Internet governance, except in matters of national security, Shri Prasada stressed the importance of strengthening the Internet Governance Forum, advancing Universal Acceptance and Multilingual Access, promoting Open Standards, prioritizing DNS stability, and ensuring meaningful participation of the Global South. Highlighting trust as the bedrock of the digital future, the Union Minister of State also emphasised the need to balance innovation with safety, privacy, human rights and sustainability. He also invited all Member States to the IndiaAI Impact Summit in February 2026, guided by the principle “Sarvajan Hitay, Sarvajan Sukhay”—Welfare of All, Happiness for All. Concluding his statement, Shri Prasad also appreciated the stewardship of Mr. Ekitela Lokaale, Permanent Representative of Kenya, and Ms. Suela Janina, Permanent Representative of Albania, in facilitating the WSIS+20 outcome document. He added that WSIS+20 offers a defining opportunity to ensure that digital progress bridges divides, empowers societies and reinforces human dignity, and reaffirmed India’s readiness to work with all nations to build an inclusive digital future where no one is left behind. *** MSZ (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205220) आगंतुक पटल  : 64 Ministry of Electronics & IT Shri Jitin Prasada, Union Minister of State delivers the national statement at the High-level Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on the overall review of the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS+20) in New York प्रविष्टि तिथि:

                17 DEC 2025 3:57PM by PIB Delhi Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Bhupender Yadav today chaired a high-level meeting to undertake a detailed review of the Action Plans of the Municipal Bodies of Delhi and Sonipat, for tackling air pollution in Delhi-NCR cities. This was the third meeting in the ongoing series of structured reviews, conducted on prescribed parameters and formats as directed by the Minister in the earlier meeting held on 03.12.2025. The Minister directed officers to remain closely connected with ground-level realities, identify the major sources of pollution in the NCR, and evolve practical and implementable solutions. Stressing the need to improve the global image of the National Capital, Shri Yadav underscored the importance of a ‘Whole-of-Government’ and ‘Whole-of-Society’ approach to effectively address air pollution. Issuing specific directions, the Minister stated that Construction and Demolition (C&D) activities must not be permitted unless C&D waste handling and processing infrastructure is identified and created within a 10 km radius of the construction site. He further directed that provisions be made to prohibit demolition during the peak pollution period in the NCR from October to December, with immediate directions to be issued pending amendments in the rules. Inspection drives were ordered to be launched forthwith across NCR cities, with strict action against defaulters. Emphasising that challans should not be an end in itself, the Minister called for a practical approach, focusing on targeting major polluters rather than inconveniencing the common public. “Motivate stakeholders, persuade the public, and act firmly against defaulters,” he said. Shri Yadav also directed that proper placement of multi-level parking facilities in Delhi be ensured so that they do not themselves become sources of traffic congestion. He instructed the removal of illegal parkings and encroachments from 62 identified traffic congestion hotspots in the city. A detailed plan is to be prepared to identify road corridors and enable signal-free movement during peak traffic hours from 9–11 am and 4–7 pm, in coordination with Delhi Police. Vehicles below BS-IV standards are not to be allowed on these corridors. The Minister stressed that unplanned urban expansion must be checked and called for last-mile connectivity for residents of high-rise buildings to nearby public transport hubs to increase use of public transport facilities and reduce peak-hour congestion. He also directed exploration of the expansion of waste-to-energy plants at Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) dump sites and identification of open spaces for greening through public participation, including adoption of parks and water bodies. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi was asked to adopt a 360-degree approach encompassing legislative reforms, enforcement action, and provision of alternative solutions to people living or working in encroachments . These measures are to be on the lines of voluntary relocation models followed in tiger reserves, with the objective of eliminating traffic congestion and pollution hotspots. The Minister further directed fast-tracking the liquidation of Okhla, Bhalswa and Ghazipur legacy waste dump sites to achieve tangible results by the end of 2026. Removal of stray animals from roads was also emphasised to prevent accidents and traffic jams. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) was requested to analyse PNG production and consumption bills of industrial units to assess the actual transition of polluting units to clean fuel. The Minister stressed the need for sustained awareness programmes to bring about behavioural change among all stakeholder groups and encouraged voluntary public participation. IEC activities were directed to focus on actual pollution stakeholders such as industries and construction companies, making them aware of applicable by-laws and parameters. CAQM was asked to revise IEC guidelines accordingly. Shri Yadav also called for provision of heating devices to workers through CSR initiatives to prevent biomass and MSW burning in the NCR. Emphasising handholding and supportive facilities to enable behavioural change , the Minister called upon citizens to become active partners in the fight against air pollution and urged all agencies to work in mission mode to achieve a 40 per cent reduction in AQI over the next one year. The meeting was attended by the Secretary (MoEFCC), Chairman, Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), senior officers of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), Secretary (Environment & Forest), GNCTD, and Municipal Commissioners of Delhi and Sonipat. ***** VM (रिलीज़ आईडी: 2205235) आगंतुक पटल  : 102 Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Union Environment Minister Chairs High-Level Review on Air Pollution Mitigation Action Plans of Delhi and Sonipat, the Third in Series of Review Meetings for Delhi-NCR Shri Bhupender Yadav calls for a Practical Approach in identifying Sources of Pollution and evolving Implementable Solutions, Targeting Major Polluters rather than Inconveniencing the Common Public Remove Encroachments, Liquidate Legacy Waste Dump Sites; Improve Last-mile Public Transport Connectivity, Identify Road Corridors for Signal-Free Movement during Peak Traffic Hours in Delhi: Shri Yadav प्रविष्टि तिथि:

                17 DEC 2025 4:50PM by PIB Delhi and (b) As informed by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), the CSIR–Central Food Technological Research Institute (CSIR–CFTRI), Mysuru–a constituent laboratory of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) had undertaken four Grant-in-Aid projects related to the study and development of annatto. Out of the four projects three were funded by Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) and one by Department of Biotechnology (DBT).  The institute is also participating in the CSIR Mission Mode project titled “Bioresource Conservation & Prospection (CSIR-BioCap)” which envisages the development of Vitamin-E enriched annatto oil for use in food and cosmetic applications, among others. CSIR–CFTRI has developed and successfully demonstrated following post-harvest technologies related to annatto: Annatto Dye Preparation – The developed process involves the batch type percolation technique using counter current extraction of annatto seeds with selective solvents and further solvent recovery and vacuum dehydration of concentrated dye to crystal like form. The crystal-like dye can be further used in the formulations in the form of water soluble, oil soluble and refined powder. Annatto Seed Separator - A small, continuous power operated machine was designed and developed for the separation of annatto seeds from pods. The machine was conceived as a low-cost, easy-to-dismantle and easy-to-fabricate device for removing the seed from the annatto pod with the machine capacity of 100 kg/hr having seed output of 40 kg/hr . In addition to the above, CSIR–CFTRI has undertaken studies by visiting relevant industries and by engaging experts in various commercial and traditional food sectors to explore the application of different annatto-based formulations such as oil-soluble, water-soluble, propylene glycol (PG)-based, sugar-based and acid-soluble colorants. Colour concentrations for these formulations were standardized to obtain the required shades across different food sectors, and the dye concentration and suitability were evaluated for a variety of commercial and traditional food products. Tailor-made formulations based on water-soluble carbonate systems were found suitable for use in hard-boiled candies, vermicelli, gold fingers, and fast foods such as biriyani and vegetable manchurian. Similarly, PG-based tailor-made formulations were found suitable for traditional sweetmeats such as boondi laddu and motichoor laddu, as well as dairy and bakery products including butter, cheese, biscuit cream, bakery cream, and icing cream. The sugar-powder formulation was found convenient for application in hard-boiled candies, jalebi, jangri, and boondi laddu. As, informed by the Tamil Nadu Agriculture University, Annatto is a moderately drought tolerant and requires less water. Planting is done during the monsoon season (June to September). Forest college and Research Institute (FC & RI), Mettupalayam has developed precision silvicultural practices and canopy management practices for maximizing seed yield in Annatto.

                17 DEC 2025 4:47PM by PIB Delhi As per 20 th Livestock Census, 2019, country has 193.46 million cattle population and out of this 142.11 million are indigenous and nondescript cattle, which is 73.45% of the total cattle population in the country. In order to supplement the efforts made by the States and Union Territories, to conserve, promote and increase the population of  indigenous bovine breeds, Government of India is implementing Rashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM) for development and conservation of indigenous breeds, genetic upgradation of bovine population and enhancement of milk production and productivity of bovines. All indigenous bovine breeds as recognised by National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources are covered under the scheme. Following steps are being taken under the scheme: (i) Implementation of Nationwide Artificial Insemination Programme (NAIP) using semen of high merit bulls including bulls of indigenous breeds. Under the component Artificial Insemination (AI) services is delivered free of cost at farmers’ doorstep in the districts with less than 50% AI coverage. During the last 3 years 5.12 crore animals covered, 8.99 crore AI performed and 2.85 crore farmers benefitted. The details of beneficiaries benefitted during the last three years state wise is given at Annexure-I. (ii)        The Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Government of India has established sex sorted semen production facilities and implementing Accelerated Breed Improvement Programme using sex sorted semen with the aim to produce female calves up to 90% accuracy thereby enhancing milch cattle population, breed improvement and farmers' income. Government has launched indigenously developed sex sorted semen technology to deliver sex sorted semen at reasonable rates to farmers including sex sorted semen of indigenous breeds. (iii) Implementation of progeny testing and pedigree selection for production of high genetic merit bulls including bulls of indigenous breeds like Gir, Sahiwal, Tharparkar, Kankrej, Hariana, Rathi, Gaolao breeds of cattle and Murrah, Mehsana, Jaffarabadi, Pandharpuri, Nili Ravi, Banni breeds of buffalo. High genetic merit bulls of indigenous breeds produced under the programme are being made available to semen stations for semen production. (iv) Implementation of In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Technology: To propagate elite animals of indigenous breeds, the Department has established 24 IVF laboratories. The technology has important role in genetic upgradation of bovine population in single generation. Further, to deliver technology at reasonable rates to farmers Government has launched indigenous IVF media.

                        17 DEC 2025 4:47PM by PIB Delhi As per 20 th Livestock Census, 2019, country has 193.46 million cattle population and out of this 142.11 million are indigenous and nondescript cattle, which is 73.45% of the total cattle population in the country. In order to supplement the efforts made by the States and Union Territories, to conserve, promote and increase the population of  indigenous bovine breeds, Government of India is implementing Rashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM) for development and conservation of indigenous breeds, genetic upgradation of bovine population and enhancement of milk production and productivity of bovines. All indigenous bovine breeds as recognised by National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources are covered under the scheme. Following steps are being taken under the scheme: (i) Implementation of Nationwide Artificial Insemination Programme (NAIP) using semen of high merit bulls including bulls of indigenous breeds. Under the component Artificial Insemination (AI) services is delivered free of cost at farmers’ doorstep in the districts with less than 50% AI coverage. During the last 3 years 5.12 crore animals covered, 8.99 crore AI performed and 2.85 crore farmers benefitted. The details of beneficiaries benefitted during the last three years state wise is given at Annexure-I. (ii)        The Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Government of India has established sex sorted semen production facilities and implementing Accelerated Breed Improvement Programme using sex sorted semen with the aim to produce female calves up to 90% accuracy thereby enhancing milch cattle population, breed improvement and farmers' income. Government has launched indigenously developed sex sorted semen technology to deliver sex sorted semen at reasonable rates to farmers including sex sorted semen of indigenous breeds. (iii) Implementation of progeny testing and pedigree selection for production of high genetic merit bulls including bulls of indigenous breeds like Gir, Sahiwal, Tharparkar, Kankrej, Hariana, Rathi, Gaolao breeds of cattle and Murrah, Mehsana, Jaffarabadi, Pandharpuri, Nili Ravi, Banni breeds of buffalo. High genetic merit bulls of indigenous breeds produced under the programme are being made available to semen stations for semen production. (iv) Implementation of In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Technology: To propagate elite animals of indigenous breeds, the Department has established 24 IVF laboratories. The technology has important role in genetic upgradation of bovine population in single generation. Further, to deliver technology at reasonable rates to farmers Government has launched indigenous IVF media. Genomic Selection:  To select High Genetic Merit (HGM) animals and to accelerate genetic improvement of cattle and buffaloes, the Department has developed unified genomic chips—Gau Chip for indigenous cattle and Mahish Chip for indigenous buffaloes—specifically designed for initiating genomic selection of high genetic merit animals in the country.

                17 DEC 2025 12:17PM by PIB Delhi India’s fisheries sector has undergone a remarkable transformation over the past seven decades, shifting from a predominantly marine-based activity to an inland and aquaculture-driven powerhouse. Total fish production surged from 7.52 lakh tonnes in 1950–51 to an estimated 197.75 lakh tonnes in 2024–25 (provisional) recording a 26-fold increase. Over the last decade, the Government of India has significantly scaled up investments in the sector, channeling Rs 39,272 crore through major initiatives such as the Blue Revolution Scheme, FIDF, Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana, and PM Matsya Kisan Samridhi Sah-Yojana (PMMKSSY). These interventions have propelled fish production from 95.79 lakh tonnes in 2013–14 to 197.75 lakh tonnes in 2024–25 (provisional), an impressive growth of over 100%. Shrimp production, India’s flagship aquaculture commodity, expanded by 267%, rising from 3.22 lakh tonnes (2013–14) to a record 11.84 lakh tonnes (2023–24). India’s seafood exports have more than doubled during the same period, increasing from Rs 30,213 crore in 2013–14 to Rs 62,408 crore in 2024–25, marking a 111.73% rise despite pandemic disruptions and persistent non-tariff barriers in global markets. The fisheries sector is a vital pillar of India’s economy and social fabric, supporting nearly three crore fishers and fish farmers and several lakh workers across the value chain. As an affordable, nutrient-rich source of animal protein, fish significantly contributes to national food and nutritional security. India’s rapid growth in fish production and exports has been driven by technological innovation, strong institutional support, and proactive policy measures. Under the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY), the Department of Fisheries has modernized infrastructure and introduced advanced technologies through interventions such as genetic improvement of key species; establishment of brood banks, brood stock multiplication centres, hatcheries, and seed-rearing units; construction of diverse grow-out ponds; development of raceways and reservoir cage culture; promotion of RAS and biofloc systems; expansion of sea cages; species diversification; and modernization of the fishing fleet. To further accelerate growth, 34 Production and Processing Clusters have been notified across States and Union Territories to enhance production, productivity, and value addition. India’s marine fisheries have long been anchored in sustainability, guided by the National Policy on Marine Fisheries, 2017, which promotes an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management. Government schemes have consistently advanced sustainable practices, with a strong focus on expanding deep-sea fishing and enabling traditional fishers to access distant areas of the EEZ. Under PMMSY, support has been extended for 480 deep-sea fishing vessels and the upgradation of 1,338 vessels for traditional fishermen. A recent, major milestone in this regard is the notification of the Sustainable Harnessing of Fisheries in the EEZ Rules, 2025, empowering traditional and small-scale fishers, cooperatives, and FFPOs to tap untapped offshore resources, enhance processing and export opportunities, and strengthen national self-reliance in deep-sea fisheries. Science-based measures such as fishing bans during spawning seasons, minimum legal sizes, bycatch reduction, improved onboard handling, sea ranching, artificial reefs development, and protection of Essential Fish Habitats such as spawning and feeding grounds are taken for ensuring sustainability of the marine fisheries. Mariculture is being promoted alongside capture fisheries through the schemes and policies. The Department on 21 November 2025 brought out the Standard Operating Procedure for Mariculture (2025) to foster responsible, inclusive coastal development. To build climate resilience, PMMSY is developing 100 Climate Resilient Coastal Fishermen Villages, making coastal villages more resilient and economically vibrant. The Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying signed a Technical Cooperation Programme (TCP) with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in March 2025 for “Strengthening of Blue Ports in India,” fully funded by FAO with an allocation of USD 100,000. The TCP supports two pilot Smart and Integrated Fishing Harbour projects at Vanakbara (Diu) and Jakhau (Gujarat), aimed at modernizing fishing infrastructure with a strong focus on environmental sustainability, operational efficiency, and safety. By integrating smart technologies, these harbours are expected to streamline operations, enhance safety standards, and promote eco‑friendly practices. In addition, the Department of Fisheries, in collaboration with FAO and the Government of Andhra Pradesh, is implementing a Global Environment Facility (GEF‑8) project titled “Transforming Andhra Pradesh Aquaculture to a Sustainable, Reduced Footprint and Climate‑Resilient Food System.” The initiative focuses on advancing sustainable aquaculture in the State. The GEF Secretariat has approved the project with a grant of USD 13,155,657 (approximately Rs 18 crore), marking a significant step toward climate‑resilient and environmentally responsible aquaculture development. Under PMMSY, the Department of Fisheries has approved Andhra Pradesh’s proposals for 39 activities at a total cost of Rs 2,398.72 crore, with a central share of Rs 559.10 crore, of which Rs 482.55 crore has been released during 2020–21 to 2024–25. For Telangana, proposals amounting to Rs 347.20 crore have been approved, with a central share of Rs 109.92 crore and Rs 85.54 crore released for fisheries and aquaculture development.

                17 DEC 2025 11:59AM by PIB Delhi (a):       The post-harvest infrastructure such as ice plants, cold storages and fish kiosks have been implemented in association with State Governments, Union Territories (UTs) under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme Component of Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY). The Central fund for implementation of such post harvest infrastructure projects is provided to concerned State Governments and UTs under PMMSY. The post-harvest infrastructure facilities developed under PMMSY and earlier schemes have been contributing in fish preservation, maintaining of fish quality, increase of shelf life of fish & fisheries products for higher price realization to fishers, fish farmers and other associated stakeholders. The recent study title “Assessment of Post Harvest Losses in Inland and Marine Fisheries” conducted through the National Productivity Council (NPC) revealed that the national average of post-harvest losses in inland fisheries has been reduced from 18% (FY 2019-20) to 8.84% (FY 2023-24) and in marine fisheries it is reduced from 21% (FY 2019-20) to 9.3% (FY 2023-24). This study further reported the average national post harvest losses in fisheries sector at 9.16% during 2023-24. (b):       The high resolution, geo-tagged household and infrastructure-level granular digital data collected under the National Marine Fisheries Census facilitate targeted delivery of schemes, identification of vulnerable groups, assessment of infrastructure gaps (harbours, markets, cold chains) and support climate-resilient livelihood-based interventions & evidence-based planning. Further, the geo-referenced digital database is anticipated to strengthen the  policy planning for fisheries sector, supports evidence-based infrastructure investments, enhance livelihood initiatives by identifying training needs and improving scheme access to fishing communities. This also facilitate better monitoring of sustainability parameters, shift to digital workflows improves efficiency, accuracy, and transparency in operations. (c) and (d):      The Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying recognizing the importance of developing the coastal communities, has taken up a transformative initiative under the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) to develop the existing 100 Coastal Fishermen Villages(CFV) situated close to the coastline in all Coastal States and Union Territories(UTs) as Climate Resilient Coastal Fishermen Villages(CRCFV) and to make them as economically vibrant fishermen villages. This programme with 100% central funding is implemented through the National Fisheries Development Board. It is reported that proposals of various coastal State Government and Union Territories for development of 95 existing coastal villages as Climate Resilient Coastal Fishermen Villages (CRCFVs) at a total cost of Rs.190 crore have been approved and central funds to a tune of Rs.47.50 crore to the State Governments/UTs. The Climate Resilient Coastal Fishermen Villages programme inter-alia envisages development of various climate resilient livelihood activities like open sea cage culture, seaweed and bivalve cultivation to create and sustain the alternative livelihood for coastal fishermen. (e):   PMMSY inter-alia supports for creation of cold chain facilities and under this scheme, during the last five years (FY2020-21 to FY2024-25), proposals for development of 734 cold storages and ice plants, 27,301 units of fish transportation facilities such as 10924 motorcycles with ice boxes, 9412 bicycles with ice boxes, 3915 auto rickshaws, 1265 Live fish Vending units, 1406 insulated trucks and 379 refrigerated trucks, 6410 fish Kiosks, 202 fish retail fish markets, 21 wholesale fish markets have been approved. The Government of Karnataka has reported that construction of 20 ice plants/cold storages of various capacities, modernization and up-gradation of a fishing harbour, purchase of 4 refrigerated vehicles, 16 insulated vehicles, 7 three-wheelers with ice boxes and 15 motorcycles with ice boxes have been supported under PMMSY in Dakshina Kannada District of Karnataka. (f):       The Department of Fisheries, Government of India has so far accorded approvals to the proposals of Government of Odisha for development of fisheries and aquaculture including infrastructure at a total cost of Rs.1298.25 crore under PMMSY. This includes development of one fishing harbour, 38 ice plants/cold storages, livelihood support to 68000 fishers families, insurance coverage of 53,91,593 fishers with an average of about 1.08 lakh annually in the State of Odisha. Under the PMMSY scheme, identification of the beneficiaries effectively covering the beneficiaries in various districts and extending the benefits of PMMSY to the eligible beneficiaries is done by the Government of Odisha. (g):       The Department of Fisheries, Government of India is presently implementing Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana and only 100 coastal fishermen villages are identified as of now for development as Climate Resilient Coastal Fishermen Villages under this ongoing scheme.

                17 DEC 2025 11:29AM by PIB Delhi The Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Government of India has undertaken different schemes and programmes namely Blue Revolution, Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF), Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) and Pradhan Mantri Matsya Samridhi Sah Yojana (PM-MKSSY) from 2015-16 for development of fisheries sector in the country with an investment worth ₹38,572 crore. As a result of the concerted efforts of Government through these schemes and well-thought policies, the annual fish production has increased to 195 lakh tonne (p) (FY 2024-25) from 95.79 lakh tonne (FY 2013-14) registering growth of 103%. The Seafood exports have also doubled from ₹30,213 crore in 2014-15 to ₹62,408 crore in 2024-25 registering growth of 107%, with share of value-added products rising from 2% to 11%. Under PMMSY, during 2020-21 to 2024-25, the Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying has so far approved fisheries development proposals worth ₹21,274.16 crore  with central share of ₹9,189.79 crore. To enhance India’s global competitiveness in fisheries sector, the PMMSY supports a basket of interventions/activities along the fisheries value chain including quality fish production, expansion, diversification and intensification of brackish water aquaculture, promotion of export-oriented species, infusion of technology, robust disease management and traceability, training and capacity building, creation of modern post-harvest infrastructure with seamless cold chain, development of modern fishing harbours and fish landing centres etc. During last five years, the PMMSY has contributed significantly  in overall growth of the fisheries and aquaculture especially, (i) increase of annual fish production from 141.64 lakh tonne in 2019-20 to 195 lakh tonne (p) in 2024-25 registering growth of 38%, (ii) increase in fisheries export from ₹46,662.85 crore in 2019-20 to ₹62,408 crore in 2024-25 registering growth of 34%. To take forward the achievements of PMMSY, on the occasion of World Fisheries Day i.e. 21 st November, 2025, the National Framework on Traceability in Fisheries and Aquaculture 2025 was released as a sub activity under PM-MKSSY with the aims and objectives to establish a national digital traceability system across the fisheries and aquaculture value chains, ensure regulatory compliance for both domestic standards and international requirements for fish and fishery products, promote food safety and quality assurance, bring transparency, accountability and enhancing consumer confidence, facilitate market access for small-scale fishers and farmers in domestic and international trade ultimately boosting export. As the framework has been launched recently on 21.11.2025, it does not warrant any review at this stage. Besides, the Department of Fisheries has not undertaken any pilot projects on traceability so far. The framework provides for a National Level Governance Committee (NLGC) as an apex body providing strategic oversight, inter-agency coordination and policy guidance to ensure the effective implementation of the framework. It also provides for an Adoption Committee under the overall guidance of NLGC to recommend mechanism for adoption of IT based national traceability system in fisheries and aquaculture by different stakeholders including fishermen, aquaculture farmers and related stakeholders. Further, it also provides for adequate support for training and capacity building of the stakeholders particularly small-scale operators for adoption of the digital traceability framework.

                17 DEC 2025 3:33PM by PIB Delhi As per Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India, subjects of Police and Public Order are with the State Governments. However, the Government of India (GoI) has been supplementing the efforts of States affected by Left Wing Extremism (LWE). To address the LWE menace holistically, a “National Policy and Action Plan to address LWE” was approved in 2015. It envisages a multi-pronged strategy involving security related measures, development interventions, ensuring rights and entitlements of local communities etc. The resolute implementation of the National Policy and Action Plan 2015 has resulted in consistent decline in violence and constriction of geographical spread. LWE which has been a serious challenge to the internal security of the nation has been significantly curbed in the recent times and has been constricted to only a few pockets. The LWE perpetrated violence incidents have come down from high of 1936 in year 2010 by 89% to 222 in 2025. Resultant deaths of Civilians & Security Forces have also come down from high of 1005 in year 2010 by 91% to 95 in year 2025. The number of LWE- affected districts reduced from 126 to 90 in April-2018, 70 in July-2021, 38 in April-2024, 18 in April-2025 and only 11 in October-2025 with only 3 districts now categorized as Most LWE Affected. The government’s focus on development in tribal and remote areas has addressed the root cause of Naxalism.

                        17 DEC 2025 3:33PM by PIB Delhi As per Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India, subjects of Police and Public Order are with the State Governments. However, the Government of India (GoI) has been supplementing the efforts of States affected by Left Wing Extremism (LWE). To address the LWE menace holistically, a “National Policy and Action Plan to address LWE” was approved in 2015. It envisages a multi-pronged strategy involving security related measures, development interventions, ensuring rights and entitlements of local communities etc. The resolute implementation of the National Policy and Action Plan 2015 has resulted in consistent decline in violence and constriction of geographical spread. LWE which has been a serious challenge to the internal security of the nation has been significantly curbed in the recent times and has been constricted to only a few pockets. The LWE perpetrated violence incidents have come down from high of 1936 in year 2010 by 89% to 222 in 2025. Resultant deaths of Civilians & Security Forces have also come down from high of 1005 in year 2010 by 91% to 95 in year 2025.

                17 DEC 2025 3:55PM by PIB Delhi The Over-the-Top (OTT) sector has significantly contributed towards India’s soft power by enabling global access to Indian stories, creative talent, cultural heritage, and independent filmmaking. As per industry estimates (FICCI-EY Media & Entertainment Industry Report 2025), the video subscription revenues grew at 11% in 2024 to reach Rs. 9,200 cr. The number of users paying for streaming content on OTT are estimated between 9.5-11.8 crore individuals. Public Broadcaster’s platform WAVES OTT has further strengthened this outreach by making Doordarshan and All India Radio’s rich archives, regional arts, documentaries, classical music, literature-based programming, and multilingual content accessible to audiences worldwide. WAVES OTT has introduced a framework to support emerging filmmakers and creators, providing them with a technology-driven distribution platform to reach diverse global audiences. WAVES OTT is primarily a subscription-free public service platform and does not operate on a subscription-based model. Advertising is its main source of revenue. It focuses on democratising access to public broadcasting content across India and globally. The platform is currently in a growth and expansion phase, with a steadily increasing international user footprint. Revenue streams from international markets are being progressively developed through strategic partnerships. User growth has shown a significant upward trend with more than 80 Lakh downloads users in the first year of launch. This reflects the rising demand for multilingual Indian content and public service media on digital platforms. The newly inserted Section 7(1B)(ii) of the Cinematograph Act, 1952 (as amended in 2023), empowers the Central Government, under Section 79(3) of the Information Technology Act, 2000 to take remedial action against intermediaries hosting pirated film contents.

                17 DEC 2025 2:23PM by PIB Delhi The policies of the Government are aimed at ensuring an Open, Safe and Trusted and Accountable Internet for its users, including women and children. The Government is committed to ensure that the Internet in India is free from any form of unlawful content or information, particularly vulgar and obscene content. Legal frameworks to counter unlawful content on digital platforms Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000 The IT Act and the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (IT Rules, 2021), together, have put in place a stringent framework to deal with unlawful and harmful content in the digital space. It imposes clear obligations on intermediaries to ensure accountability. The IT Act provides punishment for various cyber offences such as privacy violations (section 66E), publishing or transmitting obscene or sexually explicit content (sections 67, 67A, 67B). It also empowers Police to investigate offences (section 78), enter public place and search and arrest suspected person (section 80). IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 The IT Rules, 2021 cast due-diligence obligations on intermediaries, including social media intermediaries, and require them to implement these obligations effectively so as to prevent the hosting or transmission of unlawful content. Key provisions under IT Rules, 2021: Provision Details Restricted information under Rule 3(1)(b) Restricts hosting, storing, transmitting, displaying or publishing information/content that, among other things, is: obscene, pornographic, invasive of another’s privacy, insulting or harassing on the basis of gender, racially or ethnically objectionable, or promoting hate or violence; harmful to child; deceives or misleads, including through deepfakes; impersonates others, including via Artificial Intelligence; threatens national security or public order; violates any applicable law. User Awareness Obligations Intermediaries must clearly inform users through terms of service and user agreements about the consequences of sharing unlawful content, including content removal, account suspension, or termination. Accountability in Content Removal Intermediaries must act expeditiously to remove unlawful content upon court orders, reasoned intimation from Government, or user grievances, within prescribed timelines. Grievance Redressal Intermediaries to appoint Grievance Officers Mandates to resolve complaints through removal of unlawful content within 72 hours. Content violating privacy, impersonating individuals, or showing nudity must be removed within 24 hours against any such complaint. Grievance Appellate Committees (GACs) Mechanism Users can appeal online at www.gac.gov.in if their complaints are not addressed by the intermediaries’ Grievance Officers. GACs ensure accountability and transparency of content moderation decisions. Assistance by Intermediaries to Government Agencies Intermediaries must provide information under their control or assistance to authorised Government agencies for identity verification, or for the prevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution of offences, including cyber security incidents. Additional Obligations of significant social media intermediaries (SSMIs) (i.e., social media intermediaries having 50 lakhs or above registered user base in India) SSMIs offering messaging services must help law enforcement trace originators of serious or sensitive content. SSMIs to use automated tools to detect and limit spread of certain unlawful content. SSMIs to publish compliance reports, appoint local officers, and share physical address based in India for compliances and law enforcement coordination. SSMIs to offer voluntary user verification, internal appeals, and fair hearing before taking suo-moto action. In case of failure of the intermediaries to observe the legal obligations as provided in the IT Rules, 2021, they lose their exemption from third party information provided under section 79 of the IT Act. They are liable for consequential action or prosecution as provided under any extant law. Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023 The BNS, 2023 strengthens the legal framework to address offences involving online harm, obscenity, misinformation and other cyber-enabled crimes, including those committed through social media platforms. Provides punishment for offences like obscene acts (Section 296), sale of obscene material including display of any such content in electronic form (Section 294) Similarly, to address the negative effects of harmful content on OTT platforms, Government has notified the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media, Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 on 25.02.2021 under IT Act, 2000. Part-III of the rules provides for a Code of Ethics for digital news publishers and publishers of online curated content (OTT platforms). OTT platforms are under obligation not to transmit any content which is prohibited by law for the time being in force. The Government has so far disabled public access in India for 43 OTT platforms for displaying obscene content. The Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting and Parliamentary Affairs, Dr. L.

                17 DEC 2025 12:47PM by PIB Delhi The population of Parsis (Zoroastrians), a notified minority community under the National Commission of Minorities Act 1992, has declined from 1,14,000 in 1941 to 57,264 in 2011 as per census data. In order to arrest the decline in population and reverse the trend, the Government of India through the Ministry of Minority Affairs launched the Jiyo Parsi Scheme in 2013-14. The scheme has three components: i) Medical Assistance – to provide financial assistance to Parsi couples for treatment for infertility, pregnancy complications and new-born complications; this is available to Parsi couples with annual family income upto Rs 30 lakh. ii) Health of Community – to provide financial assistance to Parsi couples towards care of children and dependent elderly family members; this is available to Parsi couples with annual family income upto Rs 15 lakh. iii) Advocacy – to create awareness about the benefits available under the scheme. The assistance under the scheme is being released to the beneficiaries through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode after biometric authentication and other verifications by the respective State Governments. During the last 5 years (i.e., 2020-21 to 2024-25), expenditure of Rs 17.64 crore was incurred and 232 babies were born under the scheme. An evaluation study of the scheme was conducted by International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) during 2025. According to the report submitted by IIPS, the scheme has been largely successful in reaching its intended population and there was a near-universal acknowledgement among the respondents about the usefulness of the scheme in increasing the Parsi population.

                17 DEC 2025 2:07PM by PIB Delhi The Ministry of Panchayati Raj launched SabhaSaar, an AI-enabled voice-to-text meeting summarisation tool, on 14th August 2025. SabhaSaar has been made available to all States/UTs, and Gram Panchayats are progressively adopting it for routine Gram Sabha and Panchayat meetings. As part of the pilot phase, all 1,194 Gram Panchayats of Tripura were encouraged to use the tool for the Special Gram Sabhas on 15 August 2025, and 1,047 (87%) Gram Panchayats successfully used SabhaSaar on that day. A total of 12,667 Gram Panchayats used SabhaSaar on 15 August 2025, which increased to 77,198 Gram Panchayats during the Gram Sabha held on 2 October 2025. As on 03.12.2025, a total of 92,376 Gram Panchayats have used the SabhaSaar tool for automated meeting summarisation across States/UTs. The State and district-wise details are placed at Annexure I and Annexure II . The Ministry is continuously striving to create greater awareness about the functionalities of SabhaSaar. Due to the simplicity of its use, a standard operating procedure was conveyed to the States/UTs which conveyed it further to the Panchayats. Several physical and virtual sessions have been organised by the Ministry for State/UT officials to demonstrate the functionality. The States took further action to disseminate the information among Panchayats. The AI model used in SabhaSaar operates on AI and cloud infrastructure provisioned through the India AI Compute Portal under the India AI Mission of MeitY. Data is processed within the Government framework and is not shared with any external third-party service provider. The India AI Mission under MeitY serves as the nodal agency for governance of the underlying AI infrastructure and the data generated, thereof.

                        17 DEC 2025 2:07PM by PIB Delhi The Ministry of Panchayati Raj launched SabhaSaar, an AI-enabled voice-to-text meeting summarisation tool, on 14th August 2025. SabhaSaar has been made available to all States/UTs, and Gram Panchayats are progressively adopting it for routine Gram Sabha and Panchayat meetings. As part of the pilot phase, all 1,194 Gram Panchayats of Tripura were encouraged to use the tool for the Special Gram Sabhas on 15 August 2025, and 1,047 (87%) Gram Panchayats successfully used SabhaSaar on that day. A total of 12,667 Gram Panchayats used SabhaSaar on 15 August 2025, which increased to 77,198 Gram Panchayats during the Gram Sabha held on 2 October 2025. As on 03.12.2025, a total of 92,376 Gram Panchayats have used the SabhaSaar tool for automated meeting summarisation across States/UTs. The State and district-wise details are placed at Annexure I and Annexure II . The Ministry is continuously striving to create greater awareness about the functionalities of SabhaSaar. Due to the simplicity of its use, a standard operating procedure was conveyed to the States/UTs which conveyed it further to the Panchayats. Several physical and virtual sessions have been organised by the Ministry for State/UT officials to demonstrate the functionality. The States took further action to disseminate the information among Panchayats. The AI model used in SabhaSaar operates on AI and cloud infrastructure provisioned through the India AI Compute Portal under the India AI Mission of MeitY. Data is processed within the Government framework and is not shared with any external third-party service provider. The India AI Mission under MeitY serves as the nodal agency for governance of the underlying AI infrastructure and the data generated, thereof.

                17 DEC 2025 5:12PM by PIB Delhi The regulation and oversight of gene‑editingin crops in India are guided by a comprehensive biosafety framework established under the Rules for the Manufacture, Use/Import/Export and Storage of Hazardous Micro‑organisms/Genetically Engineered Organisms or Cells, 1989 (the “Rules, 1989”), which notified under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 (EPA). The Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) administer the EPA. Development of gene‑edited (GEd) plants is conducted under strict contained‑laboratory conditions until the plants are shown to be free of exogenously introduced DNA. During this phase, Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBSCs) exercise regulatory oversight, with information reported to the Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation (RCGM). The regulatory oversight of GEd plant R&D is guided by the following: 1). Regulations and Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research and Biocontainment, 2017 2). Handbook for Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBSC), 2020 3). The notification regarding the exemption of site-directed nuclease (SDN)-1 and SDN-2 categories of genome edited plants, which are free from exogenous introduced DNA, from the provisions of Rules 7 to 11 (both inclusive) of the Rules, 1989 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 issued by the MoEF&CC vide O.M. F. No. C -12013/3/2020-CS-III dated 30 March 2022. Furthermore, the subsequent development, evaluation, and release of a genome‑edited plant as a new variety or hybrid shall be governed in accordance with all other applicable laws, acts, and regulations. 4). Pursuant to the mentioned notification the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST) notified following guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for research and development of gene-edited plants in India. i). Guidelines for the Safety Assessment of Genome Edited Plants, 2022 ii). Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for Regulatory Review of Genome Edited Plants under SDN-1 and SDN-2 Categories, 2022 In line with the regulation, investigators who have produced GEd plants free of exogenous DNA and wish to move them out of containment must submit the lab‑generated regulatory data to their IBSC seeking exemption from Rules 7‑11 of the Rules, 1989. After satisfactory review by the IBSC and acceptance of the minutes of the meeting of the IBSC by the RCGM, the IBSC conveys the exemption decision to the applicant. This mechanism aligns with international practice by distinguishing gene‑edited plants lacking foreign DNA from conventional genetically engineered plants while maintaining biosafety oversight. Category wise numbers of Biosafety Laboratories (BSL) registered with DBT is placed below. Level of Biosafety Facility Number of Laboratories BSL-1 Laboratories of this type are deemed to be at the lowest risk level. They are utilized for the study of non‑pathogenic microorganisms that present only a minimal hazard to healthy adults. In such environments, standard microbiological practices together with basic personal protective equipment (including lab coats and, where necessary, gloves), hand‑washing facilities, and easily cleanable work surfaces are required. BSL-2 750 nos. BSL-3 89 nos. BSL-4 01 nos. The crops currently being gene‑edited in these laboratories include, a wide range of species such as cotton, rice, sorghum, mung bean, banana, gerbera, saffron, tea, stevia, potato, onion, mustard, maize, pearl millet, foxtail millet, finger millet, ginger, chilli, cucumber, muskmelon, wheat, eucalyptus, pigeon pea, rice bean, groundnut, chickpea, soybean, tobacco, cauliflower, yellow sarson, rubber, apple, brinjal, sesame, papaya,ashwagandha, Artemisia annua , Coleus forskohlii , tulasi, Cannabis sativa , sunflower, urad bean, castor, sugarcane, jute, flax, Salvia officinalis , Ophiorrhiza , citrus, grass pea, lentil, black pepper, okra, and tomato. Institution wise containment facilities and details of crops undergoing gene-editing is placed as Annexure-1. During the period 2020-2025, one incidence of lab-acquired infectionhas been reported. A doctoral student of National Centre for Cell Sciences, Pune was exposed occupationally to vaccinia virus in a biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) laboratory.

********** (Release ID: 2205351) Visitor Counter : 7 Ministry of Science & Technology PARLIAMENT QUESTION: BIO-SAFETY LABORATORIES Posted On:
                        17 DEC 2025 5:12PM by PIB Delhi The regulation and oversight of gene‑editingin crops in India are guided by a comprehensive biosafety framework established under the Rules for the Manufacture, Use/Import/Export and Storage of Hazardous Micro‑organisms/Genetically Engineered Organisms or Cells, 1989 (the “Rules, 1989”), which notified under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 (EPA). The Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) administer the EPA. Development of gene‑edited (GEd) plants is conducted under strict contained‑laboratory conditions until the plants are shown to be free of exogenously introduced DNA. During this phase, Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBSCs) exercise regulatory oversight, with information reported to the Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation (RCGM). The regulatory oversight of GEd plant R&D is guided by the following: 1). Regulations and Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research and Biocontainment, 2017 2). Handbook for Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBSC), 2020 3). The notification regarding the exemption of site-directed nuclease (SDN)-1 and SDN-2 categories of genome edited plants, which are free from exogenous introduced DNA, from the provisions of Rules 7 to 11 (both inclusive) of the Rules, 1989 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 issued by the MoEF&CC vide O.M. F. No. C -12013/3/2020-CS-III dated 30 March 2022. Furthermore, the subsequent development, evaluation, and release of a genome‑edited plant as a new variety or hybrid shall be governed in accordance with all other applicable laws, acts, and regulations. 4). Pursuant to the mentioned notification the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST) notified following guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for research and development of gene-edited plants in India. i). Guidelines for the Safety Assessment of Genome Edited Plants, 2022 ii). Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for Regulatory Review of Genome Edited Plants under SDN-1 and SDN-2 Categories, 2022 In line with the regulation, investigators who have produced GEd plants free of exogenous DNA and wish to move them out of containment must submit the lab‑generated regulatory data to their IBSC seeking exemption from Rules 7‑11 of the Rules, 1989. After satisfactory review by the IBSC and acceptance of the minutes of the meeting of the IBSC by the RCGM, the IBSC conveys the exemption decision to the applicant. This mechanism aligns with international practice by distinguishing gene‑edited plants lacking foreign DNA from conventional genetically engineered plants while maintaining biosafety oversight. Category wise numbers of Biosafety Laboratories (BSL) registered with DBT is placed below. Level of Biosafety Facility Number of Laboratories BSL-1 Laboratories of this type are deemed to be at the lowest risk level. They are utilized for the study of non‑pathogenic microorganisms that present only a minimal hazard to healthy adults. In such environments, standard microbiological practices together with basic personal protective equipment (including lab coats and, where necessary, gloves), hand‑washing facilities, and easily cleanable work surfaces are required. BSL-2 750 nos. BSL-3 89 nos. BSL-4 01 nos. The crops currently being gene‑edited in these laboratories include, a wide range of species such as cotton, rice, sorghum, mung bean, banana, gerbera, saffron, tea, stevia, potato, onion, mustard, maize, pearl millet, foxtail millet, finger millet, ginger, chilli, cucumber, muskmelon, wheat, eucalyptus, pigeon pea, rice bean, groundnut, chickpea, soybean, tobacco, cauliflower, yellow sarson, rubber, apple, brinjal, sesame, papaya,ashwagandha, Artemisia annua , Coleus forskohlii , tulasi, Cannabis sativa , sunflower, urad bean, castor, sugarcane, jute, flax, Salvia officinalis , Ophiorrhiza , citrus, grass pea, lentil, black pepper, okra, and tomato. Institution wise containment facilities and details of crops undergoing gene-editing is placed as Annexure-1. During the period 2020-2025, one incidence of lab-acquired infectionhas been reported. A doctoral student of National Centre for Cell Sciences, Pune was exposed occupationally to vaccinia virus in a biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) laboratory.

                17 DEC 2025 2:55PM by PIB Delhi The Government has approved a comprehensive package of Rs. 69,725 crore featuring a four-pillar approach to strengthen domestic capacity, maritime financing, shipyard development, skilling, and reforms. Shipbuilding is considered the mother industry in heavy engineering, where the majority of the value of a built ship is contributed by heavy engineering industries such as steel, mechanical, electrical and electronic equipment, composites, etc. Further, ancillary industries also develop through the growth of the shipbuilding industry. Given shipbuilding’s high employment multiplier, there is potential for the generation of approximately 22 lakh (2.2 million) direct and indirect jobs. The Government has undertaken several measures to address both supply-side and demand-side issues in the shipbuilding sector.

Shipbuilding is considered the mother industry in heavy engineering, where the majority of the value of a built ship is contributed by heavy engineering industries such as steel, mechanical, electrical and electronic equipment, composites, etc. Further, ancillary industries also develop through the growth of the shipbuilding industry. Given shipbuilding’s high employment multiplier, there is potential for the generation of approximately 22 lakh (2.2 million) direct and indirect jobs. The Government has undertaken several measures to address both supply-side and demand-side issues in the shipbuilding sector. Stakeholder consultations have been conducted among various ministries, including cargo-generating ministries, to provide visibility for vessel orders for the shipbuilding industry.

                17 DEC 2025 2:39PM by PIB Delhi From the latest PLFS Monthly Bulletin for October 2025, the estimates of Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR), Worker population Ratio (WPR) and Unemployment Rate (UR) in Current Weekly Status (CWS) for rural, urban and rural + urban combined among male, female and person of age group 15 years and above at all-India level are given in the Table below: LFPR, WPR and UR (in per cent) according to Current Weekly Status (CWS) for rural, urban and rural+urban sectors among male, female and person of age group 15 years and above for October, 2025 sector LFPR in CWS WPR in CWS UR in CWS male female person male female person male female Person (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) rural 78.4 38.4 57.8 74.8 36.9 55.2 4.6 4.0 4.4 urban 75.3 25.4 50.5 70.8 22.9 47.0 6.1 9.7 7.0 rural+urban 77.4 34.2 55.4 73.4 32.4 52.5 5.1 5.4 5.2 Source: Monthly Bulletin, PLFS, October, 2025 The sampling design of PLFS has been revamped from January 2025 to address the requirement of high frequency labour market indicators with enhanced coverage from PLFS. Salient aspects of the change in the sampling methodology of PLFS are given below: Frequency: The revamped PLFS sample design has enabled generation of monthly estimates of key labour market indicators viz., LFPR, WPR and UR at the all-India level following the Current Weekly Status (CWS) approach. The Monthly Bulletins for the months of April 2025 to October 2025 each have been released. Upto December, 2024 PLFS provided quarterly labour market indicators for the urban areas only. In the revamped PLFS, quarterly estimates of employment-unemployment indicators are available for both rural and urban areas and hence for the entire country. Quarterly Bulletins for April-Jun 2025 and July-September 2025 have been released. Coverage: PLFS covers all the States/UTs across the country. In the revamped PLFS sample design, district has been made the primary geographical unit, called basic stratum within a State/UT separately for rural and urban sectors for selecting FSUs for most part of the geography covered. In the remaining parts, NSS region has been made the basic stratum. This will ensure presence of sample observations from most of the districts in the PLFS sample, which will improve the representativeness of the estimates generated. Further, sample size has been increased to 22,692 First Stage Units (FSUs – sample villages/ urban blocks/ sub-units) from 12800 FSUs surveyed upto December 2024 and Sample households have also been increased from 8 to 12 households. The enhanced sample size is expected to provide reliable estimates of labour market indicators with improved precision. Timely Dissemination: The results of PLFS are being released in a timely manner as per the timelines prescribed in the Advance Release Calendar (ARC) available on the website of MoSPI. The ongoing PLFS is being carried out as per NIC 2008. MoSPI has released the NIC 2025 recently in the month of November 2025. The NIC 2025 introduces a new 6-digit coding structure, in place of the 5-digit structure of NIC 2008 and represents the latest updated national standard for classifying economic activities in India which provides a comprehensive and contemporary framework for all economic activities, capturing the rapid transformation of Indian economy driven by technological advancement, innovation, and the emergence of new sectors.

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare implements the Scheme for Promotion of Menstrual Hygiene (MH) to improve it among adolescent girls (10–19 years). The scheme focuses on increasing awareness on MH, enhancing access to sanitary napkins, and promoting safe and environmentally friendly disposal practices. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare formulated the MH Policy for School Going Girls following detailed deliberations with the line Ministries. It streamlines access to low-cost MH products, gender-segregated toilets and safe disposal facilities, promotes MH education into the school curriculum, and prioritizes sensitization and awareness in all schools.

Further, one of the objectives of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) components of ‘Misson Shakti’ is to generate awareness about MH and use of sanitary napkins. The National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS 5) data shows that the percentage of women aged 15-24 years using hygienic methods during their menstrual cycles has risen from 57.6% in NFHS-4 to 77.3 % in NFHS-5. Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has developed National Guidelines on Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) for creating awareness on MHM in rural areas as part of its overall interventions related to behaviour change on sanitation and hygiene aspect. Further, Department of School Education and Literacy implements an integrated scheme namely 'Samagra Shiksha' under which State specific projects for varied interventions on menstrual health and hygiene including installation of sanitary pad vending machines and incinerators are approved. Ministry of Women and Child Development implements the Scheme for Adolescent Girls (SAG) under which, one of the components is improving their health and nutritional status and to motivate them to go back to formal schooling. Ministry of Education has issued an advisory dated 07.06.2024 to all the States/ UTs and the Heads of Autonomous bodies like Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan & Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti.

The, Department of Health Research under Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) carries out research and studies to look into the newer methods of managing menstrual health and other sustainable alternatives to sanitary napkins for their safety, acceptability, affordability, efficacy and feasibility among women in public health program setting. In addition, since 2015-16, the Menstrual Hygiene Scheme is supported by 'National Health Mission' (NHM) through State Programme Implementation Plan (PIP) route based on the proposals received from the States. The States have been instructed to take up procurement of sanitary napkin packs at prices reached through competitive bidding. In the year 2021-22, approximately 34.92 lakh adolescent girls were provided sanitary napkin pack every month as per 'Health Management Information System' (HMIS) data. The Government has also taken initiatives to improve the accessibility of sanitary napkins and good quality medicines at affordable price.
